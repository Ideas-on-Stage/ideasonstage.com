description: "Sooner or later, every start-up needs cash. It could come from clients, investors, banks or grants. But it wonâ€™t come unless the founders are able to present effectively and convince their audiences.
Ideas on Stage has helped many hundreds of entrepreneurs to create and deliver stand-out pitches, through our partnerships with Business France, France Digitale, Numa and many other accelerators and incubators.
This targeted workshop is ideal for any structure that supports start-ups."
