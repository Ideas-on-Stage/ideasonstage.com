description: "Most presentations fail to reach their objectives â€“ if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple method for producing successful business presentations, focusing on what to say, how to say it and how to use slides effectively.
This course is taught in leading companies and business schools such as HEC Paris Executive Education and Thunderbird School of Global Management."
