## About Ideas on Stage

Ideas on Stage helps leaders deliver powerful presentations, create inspiring events and empower their organizations with high quality public speaking coaching and training. In a world of boring conferences and endless meetings, you will stand out and shine.

We created Ideas on Stage in 2010, convinced that successful presentations are a key competitive advantage, and offered a revolutionary blend of storytelling, visual design and speaker coaching. Our intuition was right: our clients realized the value of high-impact presentations, kept coming back for more, and told their friends.

Today the communication experts of Ideas on Stage provide a full range of presentation services around the world in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German.
