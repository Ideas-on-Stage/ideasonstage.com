Our job is to create great presentations. If we were selfish, we would tell our clients to use presentations for everything, from the boardroom to sales meetings. While a great presentation is useful in each of these settings, we have observed that in sales meetings in particular, people rely too much on their scripted presentation at the expense of direct interaction with the client.

Most sales presentations we see are extremely long, sometimes over 100 slides for a one-hour meeting! Talking over 100 slides for one hour is definitely not the best way to make your client want to buy your products.

This is why we recommend a different approach:

- Use a pitch presentation deck of maximum 20 slides to catch the client’s attention and make them want to know more about your product and your value proposition. This first presentation is 10 to 20 minutes long maximum, leaving time for a constructive discussion.
- Favor maximum interaction with the client. The ability to listen to the client remains by far the most underrated skill in sales. Keep a supporting presentation deck with more detailed slides, but don’t try to present everything: it’s boring, and most of it is probably not directly connected to your customer’s needs. Only show slides that are relevant to the discussion if you need them.
- If you end up not needing to show any slides, but the client wants to see you again, that’s usually a sign of a successful sales meeting, and a good connection.

Effortless sales start by understanding your client’s needs and answering them with spot-on arguments and information. Try it and you will be amazed how much easier the sales process becomes.
