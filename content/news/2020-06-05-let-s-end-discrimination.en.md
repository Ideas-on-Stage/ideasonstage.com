Our June update is not about presentations, but about the news. Recent events have shown that discrimination kills, and it has to stop. Many minorities, not just in America, but everywhere in the world, have to suffer injustice for no other reason than a difference of color, gender or belief. Our position at Ideas on Stage is simple: discrimination, in any form, is not acceptable and must be actively fought. We believe that now is not the time to put out sugar coated PR statements. Now is the time for all of us to take a clear and direct position against injustice.

We're a small team. Alone, we can't do much. But if we unite our voices with millions of other voices, if we never give up, we can enact change.
