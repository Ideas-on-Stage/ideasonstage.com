Moving with purpose on stage is good. Moving around aimlessly is not. It’s what we call derivative actions, things that we do unconsciously that betray our stress, lack of confidence or lack of preparation. Luckily, it’s very easy to stop parasitic movements, but the solution sounds counterintuitive: use eye contact to "anchor" yourself on the ground.

Yes, that’s right. Making eye contact with your audience will stabilise your attention and will prevent your feet from moving you around the stage.

The trick is to always look at someone in the eye when you talk, alternating between people in various locations in the audience. Make sure you take the time to deliver at least one full sentence before shifting your gaze to someone else. And really look at the person, not just in their general direction. The effect is instantaneous: when you look at someone specific, your brain tells your body to ground and stop moving around.

If you’re still not convinced, try to force yourself to move after you have established strong eye contact with someone. You will realize that it’s actually very hard to force yourself to move once connected!

If you have trouble keeping eye contact with your audience, book a session with one of our coaches. They will help you do this naturally and effortlessly.
