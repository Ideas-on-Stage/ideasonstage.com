“There is nothing to fear but fear itself” goes the quote from Franklin Roosevelt during his first inaugural address in 1932 at the depths of the great depression. His objective was to persuade the listeners that the dangers they faced were only material, that the terror of losing what they had was the true enemy, robbing them of the impetus of moving forward and rebuilding. He later on evokes that courage and the core values of the American people would prevail this crisis. 



As we shift from powerful rhetoric to giving presentations, as a whole this mighty line from FDR can be taken for its just virtue. “There is nothing to fear but fear itself”



After all, what we all fear in presentations is succumbing to fear. Losing our means, forgetting what needs to be said, not convincing enough. Doubts, doubts and more doubt. Failure.



But fear is often generated by inaction and made progressively worse by it. It’s quite incredible the amount of people who do not act when faced by their fears. Surely fear is a mechanism of the mind to forewarn circumstances, as an intuitive bell weather, and alarm that lets us know that we should probably get on top of whatever it is that is bothering us.



It is no secret the science behind fear. Many of us have heard of the fight or flight syndrome- The two extremes due to the of loss of presence from either shrinking and hiding from an audience or coming out swinging or trying to control them. The natural balance where a true connection with an audience can be made comes from confidence and relaxation. Some people are better equipped to deal with it for sure, while others do not work from stable enough bases to manage their fear well. 



The following 7 steps are perhaps not a cure for everyone, particularly those with deep fears linked to public speaking but perhaps a guide for many nonetheless.  





1.	Command every thought step progression during your talk: This is because, from experience there are segments during a presentation where we may not master what we are talking about entirely. These knowledge gaps can be stressful for us, trying to explain something to peers that we have not fully mastered will bring a negative feedback loop from the audience as they struggle to understand. 



2.	Practice aloud in advance with your slides and timer: Practicing aloud is the best thing that any speaker can do but seldom does. We can spend hours tweaking messages, putting polish on slides but never enough time on our feet practicing. Do it with a timer so that you know exactly how long you are. In this time precious age minutes are hours. 



3.	Expose yourself to your audience: Exposure is a key word for presenting. By that I’m talking about experience, the experience of getting up repeatedly in front of audiences. It is how stand-ups learn their craft or how a boxer can only truly learn through sparring with a real partner. Getting used to timings, feeling out the other. Equally, if we can meet members of the audience prior to a presentation, get introduced, chat, this can be hugely beneficial. You must not think like an actor hanging in the wings until curtain up. This makes the task harder. 



4.	Check that all slides look good on the day and that your videos work: Many presentations have sunk due to last minute problems with slides, compatibility issues (software and hardware), fonts not downloaded, resolution issues, not having the right adaptor etc. Solution? Get there early and locate the technical person. They are your best friend. I once had a technician who literally saved me from a crashed and locked keynote during a presentation in front of a dozen Chinese fashion executives.



5.	Trust yourself. Don’t rehearse your presentation 101 times. Trust your subconscious mind and leave a little margin for the unknown. You’ll enjoy it more. 



6.	Avoid coffee: I’ve been telling people about this for years. Don’t drink coffee before presenting, especially if you know that you are sensitive to it. 



7.	Don’t be afraid of being afraid. Now I’m back to the original quote. Don’t focus on the problem, let the fear guide you to the solution.
