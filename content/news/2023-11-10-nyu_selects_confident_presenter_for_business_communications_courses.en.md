I'm thrilled to share some great news about my book, ['Confident Presenter.'](https://a.co/d/3KOcaeD) It has been selected as a core resource for the Business Communications courses at the prestigious **New York University (NYU).** 



Recently, I also had the privilege of teaching a class to NYU's Business Communications students. My hope is that these future leaders will use their communication skills to inspire their audiences, increase their influence, and make a positive impact in the world. 



**Why It Matters:**



In today's business world, effective communication is crucial. Whether you're presenting to clients, leading a team, or pitching to investors, your presentation skills can make all the difference.



The students I taught at NYU represent our future leaders in various fields. Helping them become confident presenters is not just about improving their skills; it's about empowering them to succeed.



I'm excited about these updates and wanted to share this news with you. Your interest and encouragement mean the world to me.



Thank you!
