This December 7th in an elegant boardroom along the Champs-Elysée something powerful will take place: the beloved Women on Stage workshop will return by popular demand led by [Marion Chapsal](https://www.ideasonstage.com/team/marion-chapsal/), Chief Learning Officer and Speaking Coach. Spaces are limited to allow space for each voice and leader to present and receive personalized feedback.

For over 20 years, Marion's work has helped leaders to strengthen their executive presence, enhance their presentation and communication skills, and promote gender-balanced leadership in everything she does. Before the winter holiday, women from all ranks will gather in the sanctuary of like company to explore and expand their voice as leaders.

In Marion's words: "I created Women on Stage because over the course of my executive coaching career it became clear that women at all levels needed a safer space to discuss and expand themselves in the company of their female peers and colleagues. Women need room to hear their own voice uninterrupted. And this workshop answers that call." 

We need to achieve gender-balanced leadership on stage just as much as we need it in the boardroom, the executive ranks, and in all levels of organizational management. As long as women's voices aren't fully expressed or heard, businesses and organizations will fail to reflect a successful gender-balance or achieve their full potential.
