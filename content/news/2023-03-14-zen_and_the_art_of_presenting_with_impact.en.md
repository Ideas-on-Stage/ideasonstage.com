On the 7th of March, more than 200 business leaders attended our virtual event, "**Zen and the Art of Presenting with Impact**", featuring renowned speaker **Garr Reynolds**. 

Garr covered three key principles: 

* Restraint
* Simplicity 
* Naturalness

Under the principle of **Restraint in preparation**, Garr emphasised the importance of planning presentations analogue and having the courage to remove unnecessary details in service of the audience. He also shared tips on creating a clear presentation structure.

For **Simplicity in design**, Garr advised keeping slides clear and clutter-free, using large fonts, and embracing the picture superiority effect by keeping slides visual.

Under the principle of **Naturalness in delivery**, he suggested starting with a promise rather than a boring agenda slide, keeping it short, and changing pace. He also introduced the 7 Ps of delivery.

I loved a quote that Garr shared: "Your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas. In that order." – Dr. Patrick Winston, MIT Professor

To summarise, Garr stressed the importance of preparing with Restraint, designing with Simplicity, and delivering with Naturalness.

He covered 3 principles: Restraint, Simplicity and Naturalness. 

Restraint in preparation

Simplicity in design 

Naturalness in delivery 

Ideas he shares in “Restraint in preparation”: 

* Plan your presentations analogue (sticky notes, notebook paper, flip-charts, whiteboards…). If you want to be creative, do not start from your laptop.  
* You don’t need what you don’t need. It takes courage to remove details. You need to cut things out in the service of the audience. 
* How to create a clear presentation structure 

Ideas he shares in “Simplicity in design” 

* Keep slides simple 
* Make them clear. For example, by making the font as large as possible.  
* Clutter free. Removing the clutter from your slides
* Ask yourself, “what can you eliminate to simplify things?” 
* Picture superiority effect. Brain is not interested in looking at text. Keep your slides visual. 

Ideas he shares in “Naturalness in delivery”

* Start with a promise. Don’t start with a boring agenda slide. For example, “Here’s what you are going to learn today”
* Keep it short. 
* Change the pace
