Why would people care about your product?
Why would people care about your service?
Why would people care about your project?
Why would people care about your career?
Why would people care about your investment?
Why would people care about your discovery?
Why would people care about your research?
Why would people care about your videos?
Why would people care about your book?
Why would people care about your ideas?

People are busy. People have urgent problems. People have limited attention. Big companies battle for that attention using campaigns that cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Itâ€™s up to your presentation to make them care about your topic.
