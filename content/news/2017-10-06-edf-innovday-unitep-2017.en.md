Innovation is at the heart of what keeps large companies competitive. This is why [EDF](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group) (Electricity of France) UNITEP organized a challenge to promote and reward internal innovative projects.

For the fourth year in a row, Ideas on Stage collaborated with EDF to coach said Innovators. We helped each group build a strong and original three-minute presentation on their innovation.

True to our methodology, we worked on developing the four elements of an impactful presentation: message, story, visuals and speaking. And similar to previous years, members of the Steering Committee congratulated the Innovators and Organizers on their performance.

A combination of remote coaching using Skype as well as in-person coaching in Paris and Lyon allowed employees to minimize travel time and still benefit from the advice from some of Europe's best public speaking coaches. Win, meet win.
