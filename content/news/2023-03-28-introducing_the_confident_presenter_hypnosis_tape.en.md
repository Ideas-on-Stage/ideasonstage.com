*The latest innovation from Ideas on Stage that will revolutionise the world of public speaking!*

As I was writing my upcoming book, **"Confident Presenter”,** our team at Ideas on Stage started working on a super exciting project that will complement the book.

It’s a hypnosis tape that can instantly turn anyone into a confident presenter. Using the latest in hypnosis technology – *Advanced Personality Reinstallation through Immersive Listening* – the tape taps into your subconscious mind and unlocks your hidden talents.

**Simply listen to the tape before your presentation, and you'll be able to conquer your fears and wow your audience!**

But here's the twist: the hypnosis tape turns you into a completely different person with the alter ego of a confident presenter. When you listen to it, the tape suppresses your original personality, and you become a charismatic speaker with a tendency to overshare personal anecdotes and crack cheesy jokes.

For full disclosure, there’s also another side effect to consider. The effects of the hypnosis tape are permanent.

Still, if you don’t care about the side effects and you're ready to take your public speaking skills to the next level, give the "Confident Presenter Hypnosis Tape” a try.

With the tape and my upcoming book "Confident Presenter”, you'll be unstoppable! You'll be a presentation superstar, wowing crowds with your newfound charisma and confidence.

But don't just take our word for it – check out the reviews from our beta testers:

*"I used to be an accountant, but now I'm a stand-up comedian thanks to the Confident Presenter tape." – Sarah, 27, Marketing Executive*

*"I'm not sure what happened, but after using the tape I woke up with a sudden urge to wear a cape to work. But hey, at least I'm confident!" – Mark, 35, Sales Manager*
