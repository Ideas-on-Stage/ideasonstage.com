The [Sport Social Business Lab](http://sport.socialbusinesslab.com), aka SSBL, is an incubator specialized in sport startups for the social good. It is part of the [INCO](http://inco.co.com) network.

Sport startups are no different from other startups: without a good pitch, they don't stand a chance to attract investors and grow. This is why the SSBL asked Ideas on Stage to animate a three-hour pitch workshop.

As an avid sportsman who has been active in the Startup ecosystem since 2010, cofounder Pierre Morsa was uniquely qualified to deliver this workshop. Using his trademark methodology based on the "Pitch Tower", storytelling and surprise, Pierre helped participants build a two-minute killer pitch. Each group had the opportunity to practice in front of others, and received personalized advice to improve and go further.

We wish the startups who took part at the workshop all the very best, and we look forward to seeing them at future events!
