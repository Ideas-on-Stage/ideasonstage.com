The void in the speech is the pause, the few seconds when you say nothing to let the audience breathe and absorb your message.

The void in the slide is the empty space, also called negative space, that lets your audience focus on the key content.

The void in the presentation deck is the black slide, the few minutes when you show nothing to let your audience focus on your speech.

So many presenters are terrorized by these moments that they never make a pause. They cram their slides with "stuff" until the last square centimeter is filled. Better have a small meaningless picture there than nothing. They never use black slides because they use their PowerPoint deck as a shield.

As good presenters, we should strive for the opposite. We should make frequent pauses, to mark important messages and to keep in sync with the audience. We should leave as much empty space on a slide as possible. We should use slides only when necessary.

The only void we should fear is a presentation devoid of message.
