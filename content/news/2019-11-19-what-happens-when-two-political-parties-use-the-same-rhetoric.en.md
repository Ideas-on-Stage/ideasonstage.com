What happens when two parties position themselves in a similar manner on the same topic? Simple: the one which is the mosts credible wins. By "most credible," I mean "the one that best incarnates the rhetoric".

This is a mistake that has been done by many traditional parties. Some traditional parties saw new parties start to gain popularity by advocating extremist views. So they started to adopt a slightly watered down version of these views to attract voters. But they were terribly wrong. By doing so, they got doubly punished: they destroyed part of their credibility by betraying their historical values, and they managed to give a broader acceptance to these extremist views, making them more mainstream and putting extremist ideas in the spotlight.

Traditional parties are never going to win the battle of extremism. People who are already convinced by these extremist views are going to vote for the extremist parties. People who hesitate, the extremely important floating voters, are swayed towards extremist parties, because their views are made more acceptable by being embraced by the traditional parties.

There is only one way to win against extremism. It's to fight it without compromise. Yes, there are problems that must be solved. Yes, our world is imperfect. Yes, the way some people take advantage of the system is unacceptable. Yes, immigration can cause problems. But we must never let racism, sexism or other movements based on the assumption that some humans are superiors to others become acceptable at any level of our societies.
