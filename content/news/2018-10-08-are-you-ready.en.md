It's already October and you know what that means... Firming up next year's plan. Pitching projects. Assigning budgets. And ultimately getting creative about how expire the old and invite the new, to work smarter and better personally and together. It's not time for just another step forward. It's time to leap.

At Ideas on Stage we coach, train and design for international clients and companies large and small, from CAC 40 enterprises to startups and incubators. They bring us in as outside perspective to help think big, bold and with purpose for how to serve their respective end user, both internal or external.

While working with people from such widely diverse industries, we can hear a universal theme arise: _how do we transform the inside of our organization into something meaningful, powerful and relevant in our changing economic landscape?_

Financial institutions need to become more agile. 

Corporates need startups to build innovative symbiotic solutions. 

Hospitality is shifting to meet new demands in a sharing economy.

The list goes on.

At Ideas on Stage we love bringing work and pleasure together to inspire creative thinking and optimize the power of human collaboration. And so, as we fathom our individual and collective leap, here are a few questions to help imagine the future: 

1. _what do you want to achieve next year? _
2. _how do you want your team, company or personal presence to grow?_
3. _what kind of impact do you want to have in the world? _
4. _how would you like to feel the next time you speak?_
5. _how do you plan to lean in and use your voice for the benefit of all?_

Now that you have some insight about what you want to be, say and do for yourself, your project, organization or world, we'll ask: are you ready?
