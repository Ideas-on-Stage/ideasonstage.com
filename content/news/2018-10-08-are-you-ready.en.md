It's already October and you know what that means... Firming up next year's plan. Pitching projects. Assigning budgets. And ultimately getting creative about how expire the old and invite the new, to work smarter and better personally and together. It's not time for just another step forward. It's time to leap.

At Ideas on Stage we coach, train and design for international clients and companies large and small, from CAC 40 enterprises to startups and incubators. They bring us in as outside perspective to help think big, bold and with purpose for how to serve their respective end user, both internal or external.

While working with people from such widely diverse industries, we can hear a universal theme arise: _how do we transform the inside of our organization into something meaningful, powerful and relevant in our changing economic landscape?_

* Financial institutions need to become more agile. 
* Corporates are partnering with startups to build innovative solutions. 
* Hospitality is shifting to meet new demands in a sharing economy.
* The list just goes on...

At Ideas on Stage we love bringing work and pleasure together to inspire creative thinking and optimize the power of human collaboration. And so, as fall leaves float freely carrying their message of change all around us, let's fathom our individual and collective leap. Here are a few questions to help imagine the future: 

1. _what would you want to achieve next year if you knew you could not fail? _
2. _how do you want your team, company or personal presence to grow?_
3. _how would you like to feel the next time you speak?_
4. _how do you currently prepare for important events or presentations?_
5. _how will you use your voice more effectively for the benefit of all?_

Have any ideas? Jot them down. Once you have some insight about what you want to be, say and do in 2019 and beyond, ask yourself: **are you ready?**

No matter the answer. We have seen countless times the power of intention paired with preparation and practice is an unstoppable force. You got this. And should you like any help along the way, you know where to find us.
