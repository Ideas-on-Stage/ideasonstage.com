The best time to quit your consulting job and create a startup with zero Customers is when you are 40, at the top, with two young kids and a loan to reimburse for a Parisian apartment. Just close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Count to 10. And jump into the unknown.

Several years later, here I am, as the co-founding Partner and Creative Director of Ideas on Stage and enjoying every moment of it. I work every day to create presentations with something extra special. I always look for new ways to surprise and amaze your audience.

I was interviewed in the documentary “Le pouvoir des mots” for the Canadian television, and by several magazines, including Le Monde, Le Parisien and Management.
