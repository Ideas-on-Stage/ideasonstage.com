Marion Chapsal coaches leaders in executive presence, presentation skills and gender-balanced leadership. 

Her clients know her as fun, caring and remarkably creative. One may even say she's the Mary Poppins of executive coaching; turning work into play while delivering high-quality results.

For Women on Stage, she has created the Heroines’ Journey.  Partnered with Equine coach Evelyn McKelvie in Vancouver, the two have designed unique leadership retreats for women executives to find a voice of their own, craft their #TEDlike talks and own their presence on stage.

Trained and certified by Pragmacoach and Mozaik International, she is a Master NLP coach. She was trained in Speech and Drama at the Conservatoire d’Art Dramatique de Lyon. Her work is very influenced by Brené Brown, Patsy Rodenburg and Pixar.

Graduated from SKEMA business school Sophia Antipolis, Marion has over twenty years of experience in the Education Management field. Her clients today range from Start-up founders, TEDx Speakers to top executives from luxury companies, such as EDF, Orange, Imerys, Mylan, Sanofi, Engie, Sodexo and the French Overseas Development Agency. She teaches at HEC Paris Executive.

Founder of #WomenOnStage. #TedxSpeaker. Sees life as a #comicstrip. Believes in #fairytales.
