Authenticity. Confidence. Leadership. In this professional development training participants will learn the fundamentals of what makes a successful presentation while addressing the specific challenges women face when speaking up.

*Women on Stage* was created for those who wish to:

1. **Feel more free when presenting** (disavowed of judgement and expectations)
2. **Feel more at ease in the body when expressing oneself** (or when publicly visible)
3. **Level-up leadership presence and visibility** (coherence, connection and self-confidence)

Across one or two days (depending on group request), we will offer participants [Ideas on Stage](https://www.ideasonstage.com/public-speaking-coaching/) presentation techniques along with personalized coaching in a supportive group environment. We find participants grow even faster when in a small group due to the benefits of sharing with peers and witnessing others’ breakthroughs. Practicing, even with a small public, helps us to overcome public speaking nerves, to face fears of judgement or failure and take safe risks. This is what ultimately builds the confidence to speak successfully when opportunity arises.

Originally brought to life by Marion Chapsal, today *Women on Stage “goes 2.0”* with two new torchbearers: [Rose Bloomfield](https://www.ideasonstage.com/team/rose-bloomfield/) and [Frédéric-Pascal Stein](https://www.ideasonstage.com/team/frederic-pascal-stein/). Life is not a women’s only club. Which is why we have created a balanced work space with both male and female facilitation of an agenda rich with discussion and hands-on exercises that will raise awareness and develop speaking skills. Rose and Frédéric-Pascal provide a dynamic blend of professional experience and communication expertise allowing them to adapt to the needs and level of each group.

## Why Women on Stage?

The beginning of the 21st century was marked by an explosion of female power in both the social and professional world. Equal rights, equal pay, gender respective terminology, the #metoo movement, scientific articles, international headlines featuring female leaders and entrepreneurs … the whole world is calling *women* into the light. Now more than ever is the time to proudly take the stage and share your inspiring stories and voice with the world.

Today, the notion that women are “equal to men” is news to no one. What may be newsworthy, however, is society’s shift of perception that being a woman is not just an equivalent to something male, but that **being female is** **an essential half to the whole, a powerful role and strength.** 

The world is changing fast. Global awareness may be shifting towards balance, but in many ways we still fall prey to old habits and miss opportunities to act in alignment with the new paradigm. To effectively update our behavior and communication, it is important to step back, bring our head above water, consult our inner council, build a supportive network, exchange and learn from the community and intentionally build a more balanced future together. 

We have a choice: wait another decade or more for our words and actions to slowly catch up, or … *Women on Stage 2.0.*

## Challenges Women Face

Have you felt cut off when speaking in a meeting? Have you felt caught in the double bind of how to act as a leader? Have you struggled with trusting your voice to rally engagement and buy-in?

![Challenges Women Face](women-on-stage-04.jpg)

Too many strong, accomplished, top-tier professional women are still struggling to be heard. Too many women still hesitate before sharing their point of view, feeling their throat tighten and breath shorten in the same moment they would otherwise speak. And too many women don’t act, or make the intuitive decision, dress authentically, or express themselves freely for fear of being criticised—or worse, dismissed. But why?

- There is the famous [double-bind](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obstacles-for-women-in-bu_b_5432624) theory, which proposes that in a dominantly male work world women feel trapped by others’ judgement of being too “feminine” (read: nice, approving, meek) or too “masculine” (read: bossy, opinionated, outspoken). 
- There is also the issue that the higher women grow in their career, the less they see of their female peers in the board room; we all know it is often harder to speak up as a minority. 
- There are also the studies and statistics that show the rate of interrupting women is significantly higher than interruption of male counterparts. 
- Not to mention, demotivating factors such as [wage disparities](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/03/22/gender-pay-gap-facts/), the difficulty of balancing motherhood and personal balance with professional aspirations, gender biases and the list varies for each woman and culture. 

This workshop is not built upon the idea that women are victims, but we do believe that we must begin with awareness of the challenges and blocks we face so we can move through acceptance and into fulfilling, liberating, fruitful balance. To go deeper, join the discussion.

## Workshop Overview

- Open: introduction and intention setting in circle
- Learn: presentation on sociocultural context for women and public speaking tools
- Discuss: timed group discourse on why we use our voice and sometimes don’t
- Create: intuitive collaging exercise to envision our empowered self
- Break bread: a lovely Parisian lunch together
- Present: individual presentations practicing new techniques
- Listen: group witness and constructive feedback
- Coach: receive personalized coaching on your voice, body and messages
- Close: circle-up to share takeaways and intentions moving forward

In the one- or two-day training, we will begin by connecting in an open circle where we move from the default analytical, monkey-mind consciousness and communication mode into our hearts, intuition and bodies. From there we set intentions, share a few areas we wish to focus on and create the space for personal growth and professional development. 

Then, the facilitators will present an overview of the socio-cultural context for women in public speaking today, noting some historical leaps and bounds made on the global stage, and inspiration for where women seem to be heading. Next we’ll share the essential tools for building a successful professional presentation. *In the two-day training, we can go into greater depth based on group needs around preparation, objective setting, key messages and delivery with more individual coaching.

Through mindfulness and physical warm-up exercises, women will learn how to feel more relaxed in their body while expressing themselves with power; meaning, from a place of truth, conviction and clarity. We will practice standing literally balanced in our center, feet planted and connected to the ground, breathing and speaking from our diaphragm and then trusting what comes out from there. 

In addition, before the workshop is through, we will have explored our visions for a more empowered self, identified our current strengths as leaders as well as a couple areas for growth, “taken the stage” applying new tools to individual presentations, given and received feedback from the group as well as your coaches and ultimately practiced speaking up through the blocks and into boldness.

This training is not only a lever of change for participants, but we believe is equally transformative for those around them, men and women alike. *Women on Stage 2.0* is an accelerator for cultivating personal confidence and clarity when presenting in public as well as being a stand for balance in the professional environment. It is an investment in changing the way the world at large, starting at the office, sees and values women—of course, starting with how we see and value ourselves.
