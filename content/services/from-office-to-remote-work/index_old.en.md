**This service will help you move from an office-based to a remote-based work environment in ten days. We will create an online work community whose benefits will have long-lasting positive effects on the productivity and morale of your workforce.**

Propelled into a remote work environment, managers and employees will instinctively try to replicate their traditional work environment. But they soon realize the differences: no face-to-face meetings, no informal talk at the coffee machine, impossibility to check what every employee does every single minute.

If these issues are not taken care of immediately, bigger issues will arise quickly: loss of trust between management and employees, uncontrolled suspicions and rumors appearing from seemingly nowhere, a general feeling of frustration with the difficulty to work efficiently as a remote team, loss of motivation and vision.

> Using a traditional office work model in a remote work environment is certain to deliver suboptimal results.

At Ideas on Stage, our core job is to create connections. We believe that efficient, authentic connections are at the heart of a successful remote work environment. These connections are what differentiates employees working remotely from a true **online work community**. And we practice what we preach. We have worked as a remote team since our creation ten years ago, both internally and externally with our clients. Based on those years of experience, we have devised a method to help our clients transition from office work to remote work in a few days.

We will help you build a **perennial online work community** that will create a sense of belonging and encourage best practices at all levels of your organization, no matter where people work from.{{% /picture1-text2 %}}

## Key success factors of office to remote work
There are five elements that are critical to the transition from office to remote work:

- **Objective**: having a clear objective, a clear purpose is key to keep employees on the right track when no physical office can create a sense of cohesion. A clear vision will give meaning to their work and will motivate them to work towards achieving that vision.
- **Tools**: the right remote tools, fast and easy to use, can eliminate the friction of remote work.
- **Trust**: for some organizations, this is the most difficult, yet most important success factor: move from a culture of distrust to a culture of trust. Management and employees have to move to a relationship of empowerment to maximize the results and even surpass the productivity of office work.
- **Transparency**: ensure that people know what is happening at the company and that they don’t feel disconnected.
- **Overcommunication**: remote communication is not as natural as direct communication, so talking and exchanging frequently is key to building trust and a proper work environment.

> Without key success factors secured, a remote work environment will only create a feeling of insecurity and frustration, and result in poor productivity from employees.

## From office to remote in ten days
Ideas on Stage can help you ensure a near-instantaneous transition from office to remote work because we know exactly the stress points that need to be relieved for an efficient and frustration-free remote work environment:

- Check that you have the necessary tools to work remotely.
- Build a clear vision that you are going to communicate to your employees during the full remote work period.
- Create a trust-based work environment between employees and management, by coaching them on how to create a productive remote relationship.
- Ensure that people communicate appropriately and regularly. Making sure that the focus is on solving issues, not interpersonal problems.
- Create regular online events to maintain the corporate culture, communicate the vision, reassure employees and foster a feeling of belonging in a remote work environment.

## How do we do it?
Our approach is based on three phases: preparation, takeoff and cruise mode. Provided that your team is willing to move fast, that you have the minimum set of tools to get up to speed and that you are ready to face a few intense days, we can help you transition very quickly.

### Preparation: initial assessment, plan and objectives

We start the preparation phase with an **initial assessment** of your remote work capabilities. We evaluate how comfortable you and your team are with the concept of remote work. We evaluate if the tools will allow you to work properly without creating additional friction.

From the initial assessment, we build a **comprehensive plan** tailored to your company’s strengths and areas of improvement. Our initial objective is not to provide a full replacement for your traditional work environment, but to give you the minimum capabilities to work efficiently as a remote team.

We build a **clear set of objectives** for your team. Having a clear objective, a clear purpose is key to keep employees on the right track when no physical office can create a sense of cohesion. A clear project objective will give meaning to their work and will motivate them to work towards achieving those objectives. Just like setting off on a journey, you need to have a map to arrive where you intended. The same goes for setting your work project destination, and doubly so, when working remotely. 

Following our initial assessment, we will lead a 90 min. objective setting session using our exclusive methodologies. We will identify clearly defined and measurable near-term objectives by first brainstorming the universe of possible desirable outcomes and then sorting them using our Traffic Light methodology to uncover the most crucial actions to achieve and rank in order of mission importance the remainders.  

This will result in a clear timeline, a project map, which will help employees stay on course during their solo journey, and start to build trust in the remote work environment.

### Takeoff

Based on our plan and objectives, we enter the takeoff phase: lift off the ground and get to the cruise altitude efficiently and safely.

To ensure that objectives are clear and to build the sense of belonging to the online community, we will start with an **online kick-off event**, not minimizing the challenges of remote work, but instead giving a very clear vision of how everyone can adapt and that each employee will receive support during this phase.

During the takeoff phase, managers will have **daily coaching** to address the challenges they may face adapting to remote work. As good remote management is vital to foster a good remote work environment, we strongly encourage a personalized coaching approach instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Based on the number of managers and how large your company is, we may need to create small coaching groups for managers.
 
We will organize **weekly events** to strengthen the culture of your online work community. A strong culture will encourage the right mindset across all workers in your company, and will increase engagement and motivation.

Employees will be able to attend a series of **online webinars**:

* How to conduct virtual meetings
* How to adapt their working habits to be an efficient remote worker
* How to use good communication etiquette to encourage collaboration and avoid unnecessary conflicts
* How to create a trust-based online work culture

**Trust** is at the heart of an online work community. Trust is built by making an agreement and then following through. It depends upon understanding and alignment that you both or all parties have a common idea of what success looks like. “We need to send the newsletter out on Thursday. John, can you be sure all the text is edited and Sarah, can you make sure we have rights of the images?” This is great, and sounds pretty clear, just what would be even better is adding, “Can you do this by the end of today so we can send tomorrow morning?” SMART goals can help achieve clarity and create conditions for success. 

But that’s not all. What if something comes up and Sarah doesn’t confirm we have all rights to images and the newsletter goes out? Maybe it was a slip, maybe she forgot, either way, she made a mistake and what happens now? Yes building trust is about following through, but it’s also about how we deal with things when they go awry or targets don’t get hit. It’s not just what we communicate to our team or colleagues but how. 

Here are a few examples of activities that we use to build a trust-based online work community:

- Online heart-based communication practice
- Nonviolent communication techniques, one of the key cultural changes that Satya Nadella introduced under his leadership at Microsoft
- Implementing regular online meetings with clear and empowering agenda
- Conflict or stressful dynamic resolution skills
- Recognition: make it regular and specific

Finally, if you are missing critical tools to work remotely, we will coordinate with you to find temporary or perennial solutions so that your team is not hindered. We are vendor agnostic.

### Cruise mode
The takeoff phase will help you get up to speed quickly, ensuring minimum disruption of your day-to-day work. However, an efficient remote work culture is something that is built over the course of several months. We will continue to help you address the remaining sticking points and set up a perennial remote work community that will deliver a better, more flexible workplace to all your employees and boost their productivity, delivering tangible long-term benefits for your company.

So why wait? Contact us and let’s build your remote work community.
