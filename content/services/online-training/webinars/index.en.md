## Virtual Meeting Revolution - Free Webinar Series

We’re all facing a complex, unprecedented situation, and those of us who aren’t used to working remotely may feel disconnected, isolated, or lost. Wouldn’t it be great if every team could use virtual meetings to keep a sense of community and connection?

Stop and think about that for a moment. Meetings? Most physical meetings are a waste of time and energy, and now that many of us are working from home, we’re finding that too many virtual meetings have the same problem.

Thankfully there is a solution. At Ideas on Stage we aren’t only presentation specialists: we’ve helped clients to prepare online and offline meetings - with or without presentations - for years now. More than that, we’ve worked remotely ourselves since we began in 2010, bringing together an international team, and working with clients all around the world from the comfort of our home offices. So we’ve learned much about what works - and what doesn’t work - in online meetings. 

Our Virtual Meeting Revolution online course has been in great demand recently, for obvious reasons, but there are many who need this learning around the world. So we’ve decided to run a series of free webinars that aim to help any remote worker, teacher or leader to prepare and run effective online meetings.

Inspiration has healing power for the mind like rest and nutrition for the body. With these webinars, we aim to inspire you so that you can inspire your teams, your students, your communities, and maintain a sense of connection in these challenging times.
