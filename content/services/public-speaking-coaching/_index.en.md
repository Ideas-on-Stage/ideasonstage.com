## Tailored to address each individual’s strengths and areas for improvement. 

Our coaching service is made to measure. Whether you are a senior executive set to present a high-stakes strategy, an organizer looking to have a group of speakers coached for a business event or a start-up founder who’s been invited to present at a high-profile tech event, our goal is the same: to make you succeed.

We choose the most appropriate coach for each speaker, and prepare a made-to-measure program based on our ACE Speaker Coaching approach, providing each speaker with three key benefits:

* Advice: our specialist speaker coaches will help you with your positioning, movements and gestures; your voice, pace and elocution; your use of eye-contact with the audience; and with other important points such as your attitude, emotions, breathing, etc.
* Comfort: we provide tips, tools and exercises to ensure you are physically and mentally prepared for the presentation, and transform potentially negative stress into positive energy
* Encouragement: even the most senior executives need to feel confident in themselves and their presentation, so our coaches know that as the big day approaches, they should provide less advice and more positive encouragement.

When the stakes are high, it’s important to make sure the speaker is ready to excel. Ideas on Stage has coached thousands of speakers, including many celebrities and well-known CEOs around the world. We are the secret of their speaking success.
