## Who is Ideas on Stage?

Ideas on Stage is a company specializing in presentations and corporate events.
We help turn conferences/business meetings into dynamic, memorable events, working with organizers and senior management to develop agendas, set-up the logistical aspects and prepare speakers that make a lasting impact.
We are not an event agency. We are not just coordinators. We are specialists in powerful business presentations and events. We work with clients all over the world to present their ideas and strategies clearly and memorably.


- We help leaders to create presentations, by brainstorming ideas, crafting storylines, designing high-impact slides, and coaching them to ensure they are ready to speak confidently and convincingly. 
- We help meeting organizers to inspire participants by applying our creativity and storytelling skills to design and produce original, outstanding events.
- We empower organizations with high-quality training courses and individual coaching, based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE™ method and our experience working with thousands of executives.

We design the event with you, in all its steps: advice, reflection that leads to creativity, logistics and set-up.
As we do for the training and coaching we supervise, we apply our brainstorming, storytelling and design methods in Event Management.
This methodology will help us to understand together who are your attendees/guests, what are their needs, what is the context of this event, and what are your objectives.
From this work of reflection and imagination, project management then becomes an essential part for the success of the event. We will organize and control the entire implementation of the various artistic, material, human, regulatory and budgetary elements, and ensure overall consistency, while respecting the ideally designed planning.
We will make certain your corporate event is not only memorable for the attendees, but also achieves your goals in alignment with your organizational culture.

## Set the goals

When? Where? Why? What? Who? Answering all of these questions will help you set strategic goals while determining the content of your event.
Wanting to organize an event is good. But knowing why and creating an event that makes sense is better! In any project, foundations are essential. One of the most frequent mistakes is to misdefine the expected framework and objectives. It inevitably leads to oversights and a lower return on investment. To avoid this situation, set the frame by applying the 5W rule:

**WHAT?**
What type of event do you want to organize?
Is it internal or external?
Is the atmosphere festive, relaxed, professional?

**WHO?**
Who is the target?

    > Employees, prospects, customers, suppliers, investors, press, general public, VIP…?

**WHY?**
What is the strategic goal?

    > Notoriety, brand image, visibility, loyalty…?

Why do you want to organize this event?

    > Motivate your employees, develop the corporate culture, make an announcement/inform, launch a new product, educate customers/prospects about a product or service, find new partners, present something new to the press…?

What messages do you want to convey to your guests?
What will they discover or learn?

**WHERE?**
Where will it be held?

    > Conference room, restaurant, office…?

What is the chosen geographic area?
What type of place are you looking for?

    > Atypical, cozy, warm…?

**WHEN?**
When should it take place?

    > Morning, lunch, afternoon, dinner, evening?

How long will it last?

    > A few hours, half a day, a day?

What day of the week?

Is the event the fastest, easiest and most relevant way to get your message across to your target audience? What added value can be expected from the organization of this event compared to simply sending a report, a brochure? Ultimately, is this THE solution to achieve the objectives set by your company? Here are some of the key questions to ask yourself before you get started.
This will result in many elements: the theme of the event, the subjects addressed, the speakers selected, the budget required, the tone of the invitations, the decoration and the scenography, etc.
Don't get caught up in an idea, however extraordinary it may be. Remember that an event only exists if it meets its audience!

**Whatever your objectives, these must be S.M.A.R.T.**

- **S**pecific. They are clear, understandable and as precise as possible, even out of context.
- **M**easurable. They are encrypted and allow you to track your progress and assess the result.
- **A**chievable. They must be ambitious enough to represent a challenge and boost motivation and concentration towards their achievements but without discouraging your team from reaching them.
- **R**elevant. The objectives of your event must be part of a global business strategy. Ask yourself if your event helps you meet the challenges of your business. And take into consideration your resources (human, financial, material, time); your goal should be consistent with your situation.
- **T**imebound. You need to set a date to reach your goals. Do not hesitate to break down a main objective into several steps, which can correspond to given periods (a month for example).

The type of event chosen in line with your objectives will result in the number of people expected. The questions to be asked will therefore relate to the presence or absence of accompanying persons (spouses, children), whether or not to use facilitators and speakers, or the invitation of the media to this event...
To choose the date, remember to check the school vacation periods, competing events, public holidays, periods identified as busy depending on the sector of activity, or even the electoral calendar.
Regarding the place, preferably choose a place easy to access and suitable for the expected attendance. Nothing like to annoy or discourage your visitors from placing your event far from any transport infrastructure or from planning too small (or too large). Beyond the content, it is the place that will leave a memory for your participants. Either the destination responds to a strategic reflection of the company (presence of a branch of the company, subcontractors, desire to develop in the region), or you have the freedom to choose. In the latter case, we advise you to select several as part of a pre-selection and to measure the pros and cons of each of them, before making a final choice.
About the duration of the event, it all depends on what you have to say. If there are many topics to discuss, do not hesitate to plan your event over several days so that the speakers can present and debate in good conditions.
Finally, regarding the theme, do not make this choice lightly. He will be your common thread for your communications and the promotion of your event. Above all, it allows you to convey the objectives of your event in an original way and ensures that all your guests come together around a common idea.


## Organize and set up management tools

A keyword: anticipation!
Any event is the result of a set of tasks, providers and suppliers, to-do lists, monitoring tables. The link between all: a master organization!
To keep everything going in the best of worlds and to anticipate each action, here are three essential tools:

**Retroplanning**
You will certainly not be able to remember everything. This document details each step up to D-Day. It consists of all the tasks and sub-tasks necessary for the completion of the project, classified in order of priority. Each task is assigned one or more managers, deadlines and status (to do, in progress, done, late). You will also have a global overview of the number of people mobilized for a better distribution of your staff.
You are free to choose the tool that suits you best. The larger and more complex the event, the more it will require a robust tracking tool.

**A checklist of things to think about on D-Day**
This list will be essential on the day of the event. It will be completed little by little, throughout the organization. This can range from “planning xx vegetarian meals” to “not putting the furniture on the stage until a certain time”. This list clears your mind and keeps asking you over and over again if you've forgotten anything.

**A technical timeline**
The more you advance in the organization, the more clearly the event will materialize in your mind and you will be able to program everything, minute by minute.
This timeline is the equivalent of a film script. It precisely lists everything that needs to be done, at all times and by whom. It borders the planning of the day so that the experience is as smooth as possible.
You are free to choose the tool that suits you best: a Word page, an Excel file, a Note. Will be indicated everything that everyone must do at all times and where.

Beyond these tools, do not forget 2 other aspects just as essential to the success of the event:
**Your team**
Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do. Share your planning to everyone and make a general briefing as clear as possible. It must explain to everyone their responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings and moments of hesitation when they arrive on D-Day.

**General rehearsal**
Before the big day, imagine yourself in the shoes of your guests. Step by step, experience the event. This will give you the opportunity to compare reality with what is on paper. This is also where you will be able to do technical tests and verify that everything is working well. Ask yourself at each step: “What if…”. Considering the worst allows you to better prepare and imagine each unexpected.


## Define and manage the budget

The size of your event is largely determined by your budget. It therefore deserves your full attention.
How much is your total budget? This is the first thing to know. Are you basing yourself on an imposed budget and do you need to organize your event based on it or do you plan your event first and then see how much it will cost?
How to establish it? And what part of the budget are you going to devote to each element? And what if you risk exceeding it?
There are many expense items: venue rental, reception and security staff, caterer, audiovisual equipment, furniture, insurance, etc.
It's up to you to quantify what you can hire for this event. Do you have other sources of funding (grants, sponsors, etc.)? Do you charge your participants? What are the possible sources of external revenue? Should the event be profitable or just balanced?
Again, answering these questions will guide you in your management.
There’s never enough budget when running an event. So that’s why it’s so critical to prioritize your objectives and be realistic in what you can commit to achieving. To stay on track and make sure you allocate your financial resources in the best way, here are some tips:

- Create an event budget with estimated figures to help you calculate the required budget, income targets, and break-even point of your event.
- To plan your budget, you can simply create a table and register your expenses and revenues. There are also several specific applications for calculating and managing the budget.
- Update your estimates with the actual figures as soon as budget items have been confirmed and committed to so that you can rework your budget allocation if needed.
- Have a margin, essential for unforeseen expenses.


## Find the right place
****
This is the determining success factor for your event.
You have created your budget, you have an idea of the number of guests and you know what type of event you are going to organize. You can then start looking for a place.
Here are key elements to choose THE place made for your event:

**Relevance**
The location of your event determines the image you want to convey. The overall atmosphere should reflect your brand image and represent your objectives. Study as many options as possible and carefully weigh the pros and cons of each.
Remember that the more the place moves away from the atmosphere you want to create, the more you will have to compensate with the decoration.
If all or part of your event is outdoors, consider your need for a rain location, a rain plan and/or a rain date.

**Proximity and accessibility**
The location of the place contributes to the success of your event. Make sure that it is easily accessible and that its position is relatively central. Check for parking. If your guests are traveling from abroad, then select a location near an airport and take into account accessibility by public transport.

**Capacity**
The space must be proportionate to the number of guests expected. Make sure that the space does not appear empty, or that the guests are not too tight.
Reserve extra room(s) needed for support of event (i.e. coat room, registration, prep room, etc.).

**Originality**
Nothing better to make an impression than a place out of the ordinary. An unusual place will leave a positive image and an unforgettable memory to your guests!

You have finally found a few sites that meet your constraints and expectations. Do not hesitate to contact them and ask questions:

- What is the price for the rental, including the days/hours of set-up/dismantling?
- What is the maximum number of guests?
- What are the terms of cancellation?
- Is there a caterer referenced/imposed or do you have to plan it?
- What are the audiovisual possibilities on the site? What about the power supply? Is it possible to play music?
- Is parking paid or free? Are there shuttle and taxi services?
- What can the place provide, and what should you take care of yourself?
- Is there a cleaning staff? Security staff?

You must go to the place and make a detailed visit: from the parking to the reception hall and from the event spaces to the sanitary facilities. This visit may give you negotiating arguments before you even finally accept.


## Choose your providers

Several providers will be required, depending on the configuration and size of your event.
Here are some rules for finding the best providers:

- Seek recommendations within your professional circle. Thus, you are assured of a certain quality and a successful previous collaboration. You will be able to work yourself for the long term with a service provider with which you are satisfied.


- Build a database of contacts: company, contact, website, recommendations, details of the offer, prices, availability, various comments, etc.


- Always ask for a quote detailing the costs line by line. You can then simply integrate it and adapt it to your budget.


- Do not consider any tariff as fixed. To optimize your management, do not hesitate to negotiate with the service provider or put several companies into competition.


## Make your event unforgettable

An event that bring emotion has a strong impact. It’s a great way to please, surprise, amaze, make laugh...
For this, you can use the decoration/layout of the chosen place, the quality of the presentations of your speakers and the animations.


- **How to properly prepare the place?**

Decoration has a key role in the memory that your event will leave to your guests. It’s the one that reflects your company's image in the first place. Whether for a conference, a trade fair, an internal meeting or a product launch, be creative. It is essential to create a universe linked to the message you wish to convey. Internet could be an inexhaustible source of ideas and inspiration for this. The scenography decorators are also at your service to reproduce the atmosphere you want by adapting it to the constraints of the place. They will be of great help to enhance your business and your brand identity.
It is advisable to arrange and decorate in priority the spaces which will drain the most passages and attention:

- reception desk/entrance
- the buffet
- the stage, for a conference
- the stand, at a trade show
- the place dedicated to the presentation of a product

These spaces will also be the most photographed/filmed. The setting must therefore be harmonious, the furniture in line with the desired atmosphere and ambiance.
It will be a real personalization by using colors, lights, sounds and volumes to design a warm and amazing space.

As part of a conference, it is essential to prepare the place and to ensure the technical aspects:

- The stage will be slightly raised so that the whole audience can see the speaker. It will also be large enough for the speaker to move from left to right without constraints, and to accommodate groups if necessary (such as a panel).
- Arrange for the audience to be in the shade, but not completely in the dark. This allows to film audience reactions if video teams are present.
- Good stage lighting will greatly improve the chance of having quality photos and videos.
- Provide a small bottle of room temperature water on a desk so that the speaker can drink.
- During formal presentations, the speaker often stands behind a desk. Aside from these very formal cases, we do not recommend its use, as it adds a barrier between the speaker and the audience.
- Check where the speakers are entering and leaving the stage.
- In the case of a seated audience, make sure that all guests have a seat.
- Check all the audiovisual equipment (screen, adequate slide format, video relay screen, timer, microphones, clicker with battery, sound system, connection cables to connect the computer to the projection system, etc.).


- **Which speakers to select?**

Speakers will also be a very important and meaningful way to make an impression. In many ways, your speakers will be the “face” of the event and help you attract guests.
Choose speakers who match your vision of the event and enrich its content. They can be opinion leaders who will attract participants, experts who master the subject or theme perfectly and will enrich the debate, or enthusiasts who will offer an alternative vision to participants.
Do not forget your professional network when looking for these speakers. Searching into your network has the advantage of providing a warmer introduction to a potential contact. It can also help reduce costs if they agree to join your event for free.


- **What events to choose?**

Organizing an unforgettable event undoubtedly means fun activities that will interest your guests and make them have a good time. This has several advantages:

- Impress your guests
- Create a friendly environment
- Promote exchanges between participants
- Attract people
- Generate publications on social networks

During a business event, whatever the objectives, you will have to think about activities that will make your guests comfortable, immerse them in an accommodating atmosphere where they can have fun while receiving the message you want to communicate.
Participatory games or group games are excellent animations for the purpose of a challenge. High tech events are very trendy and offer immersive and fun experiences. The unusual entertainment offers your guests the opportunity to do an activity that they would never have done elsewhere.
In any case, providers are available to help you find the best ideas for entertaining your event.


## Organize an effective communication

Everything was organized. Now you just have to start the communication and make your guests want to come! A step as crucial as planning.
If time permits, plan for "multi-channel" communication. This maximizes your chances of hitting your target. Remember to analyze it well as well as its way of consuming the contents. This will allow you to adapt the tone to be used to "speak" to your target at best.


- **Communicate before the event**

Website. This is a guarantee of seriousness for Internet users. Depending on the time and budget you have, there may be a question of a dedicated site with a specific domain name, a page on your site, or a banner at the top of your site.
Make your site attractive and clearly state the place, date and subject. Do not forget to integrate a button for the registration of your participants.
If speakers are present at your event, give them a good place, with photo, text and biographies.

Landing page. It’s on this page that a visitor lands after clicking on an advertisement or a call-to-action button via your website or social media. It allows you to easily notify participants of the various news related to your event or to send a reminder to those who have not confirmed their registration for example.

Newsletter. It is a good way to maintain the relationship with your contacts, by quickly sharing free news and by highlighting new products or services. Qualify your database correctly.

Invitations. It's up to you to choose between paper and electronic formats. Send a "save the date" to the people concerned so that everyone can block the date and organize it in advance. Resend an email just before the end of the official registration date. Just before the event, send a new reminder with all the relevant information.

Social medias. The choice of social medias to activate will depend on the target audience and its uses. Take into account the specifics of each media.
First invent a short, simple and fun hashtag for your event and use it as soon as possible.
Send as many tweets as you can.
Post your event on Facebook and LinkedIn, add a logo or image and don't forget the link to your event page.
Regardless of the media used, be sure to provide relevant, synthetic and interesting information every time. And offer to share the participation through different social medias.

Partnerships & influencers. Some organizations would surely be delighted to help you and associate their name with your event. Try to reach agreements with suppliers who can bring you something. Either by promoting your event through their channels, or by providing D-Day services or products.
Also look for bloggers, YouTube stars, Instagram icons... They are called "influencers". If they are ready to associate their name with your event, your visibility will be optimized.

Press and media. If you have time and your event is suitable, prepare a press release and/or a press kit to send to a selection of medias.

Event marketing assets also include teaser emails, mobile event app, designed posters, flyers, pin-badges and other accessories to keep the event front-of-mind.


- **Communicate on D-day**

On D-Day, communication meets a triple objective:

1. Create engagement among your audience. Invite your guests to share your event and its highlights. What could be better than a live broadcast of their messages posted live on the media? Your guests will certainly feel the need to contribute!


2. Give external visibility. You develop your notoriety and at the same time allow all those who could not be present to benefit from this content. Be active on the various social medias live, via photos, videos and quotes.


3. Create as much content as possible. Share photos, film the event, interview participants and/or speakers. This content will then be shared on medias and on your website.

Other elements are also possible to make your event attractive and interactive: quizzes and draws to win prizes; surveys to give a voice to the audience but also collect feedback on your event.


## Create an attendee engagement

People expect more from their conference and event experience than ever before. 
If a corporate event cannot generate engagement, it will impact the attendees’ ability to retain information. The week before your event is crucial for building this engagement.
Here are some principles to know:


- **Produce great content** 

A memorable event starts with engaging content. The content you deliver should support the strategic purpose of your event as well as audience interests and needs. Sharing behind-the-scenes photos, speaker’s quotes and moments to make attendees really feel like part of the experience. Ensure that your event speakers and presentations are relevant. 
Live posting on social medias during your event is an excellent way to keep your attendees engaged.
Give attendees the possibility to access the agenda, speakers bios, maps and more to prepare for the event in advance.


- **Use Gamification** 

Make your event fun and enjoyable. Add competitions or games to spice up the event. Such as musicians, professional acrobats, magicians to perform at set times. Or incorporate virtual or augmented reality into your training session. Or organize a raffle and announce the winners in between event sessions. Whatever entertainment element your choose, your attendees will appreciate the break in the planning.
 

- **Organize a Live Question & Answer session and Polling** 

When it comes to the Q&A sessions, traditional methods are often met with groans and eye rolling. Today’s event technology make it much easier to interact with your guests. Make use of a dedicated tool to enhance and improve communication. Consider collecting and curating top attendee questions and answers. Collect audience feedbacks of your event. By listening and interacting, you increase attendee engagement as well as identify opportunities to improve the overall experience.


- **Create networking opportunities**

For many, networking is the primary reason for attending an event. By creating networking opportunities -whether face-to-face or virtual, one-on-one or in groups- you can encourage and facilitate networking and create a more valuable experience for attendees.


- **Create a meeting place with your partners and sponsors**

If you’ve sold sponsorship and partnership at your event, then those paying customers will be looking for real connections with attendees, rather than just signage.


- **Adapt the seating layouts** 

Conventional seating layouts still work best for some sessions, but there are other options which can improve engagement. Different layouts serve different purposes, so consider the objectives and best approach for each session.


- **Create an event hashtag** 

Before your event takes place, create a short and unique hashtag that will be the only one promoted across your event. Have all your event speakers make use of the hashtag. Add the hashtag to speaker slides, event signage, badges, and any place your audience will go for information.


- **Create a Mobile App** 

Mobile apps are now commonplace for organizers and attendees, but remain an effective way to improve audience engagement. Well-designed event apps enable attendees to plan their itinerary at the event, receive alerts for essential information, connect with other attendees, and find answers to common questions. 

Conference engagement is a challenge but is not impossible. Using the right event technology tools, implementing feedback strategies, reconciling goals and expectations, and staying authentic should be top priorities.


## Prepare and print event collateral

What is the key to successful event collateral? It needs to be professional, easily recognizable and brand consistent. When you use the same logos, fonts, colors…over and over again, customers easily recognize your brand and easily remember your business. 
Here are 5 key points to organize and create successful event collateral:


- **List every piece of collateral items you will need for your event**

It’s easy to think about some key items like business cards and brochures, but don’t forget the little items such as signs, name badges, goodies, or the pre-event collateral as well (invitations and « save the date »).


- **Determine the size of each item**

For each item, write down the dimensions required and make sure your designers have this information. Be sure you give them as much detailed infos as possible. Your project will thus avoid delays.


- **Use templates for print collateral if possible**

Using templates helps to keep your design consistent. Make sure it is accessible to your designers.


- **Define quantities you need**

You will likely bring several different types of collateral to your event, but you may not need to bring the same quantity of each. Keep in mind that for some items, such as signs, it may be a good idea to have an extra sign printed up just in case of damages in transit.


-  **Create a timeline and fix deadlines.**

Your deadlines are going to determine the timeline for the entire project. The first step is to gather all of your deadlines from your vendors and printers. Then, create a timeline for your team/designers that allows time for possible glitches and delays. Finally, work backward to create your production timeline. 


## The D-Day
****
After weeks, even months of preparation, the big day has arrived! How to not get lost among the multitude of things to manage that day? How is it possible not to forget anything? How to make sure that everything goes smoothly? Here are the golden rules to bring your event to a successful conclusion:


- The day before, prepare everything you can and prepare for all eventualities. Scroll through the event planning in your head to review each step and consider all possibilities. A sentence should loop in your head: “What if…?”. This brings to light elements that you could never have anticipated around a meeting table.


- Install clear signage so that each person is easily able to access the site and the allocated room(s).


- Review accessibility and safety concerns and considerations.


- Reserve a significant time slot for rehearsals, set-up, etc.


- On the day of the event, arrive early! You’ll find time flies twice as fast as usual.


- Ensure the proper functioning of technical equipment (microphones, sound system, video projector, camera, computer, connections, lights, wifi if necessary, etc.).


- Have backup batteries for your electronic devices.


- Check that the cleaning has been done.


- Make sure that the deliveries have arrived (equipment, goodies, documentation, etc.).


- Print all the documents you will need (detailed briefs for service providers, checklist of “essentials”, technical timeline, flyers, programs, etc.)


- Compose a “logistics kit” with scotch tape, sheets of paper, pens, markers, cleaning products, trash bags… and everything that might be useful to you, as well as a first aid kit, in case: plaster, bandages, scissors, etc.


- Treat your briefs. If you want to ensure a smooth flow, make sure everyone knows from the start what is expected of them. Organize a briefing, in which everything is clearly and precisely indicated. If necessary, provide a copy of the technical timeline of the event with all relevant contacts.


- Keep with you the documents created throughout the organization.


- Make sure that the welcoming process for your participants is fluid and efficient.


- Look everywhere, all the time. Pay attention to the smallest details. Are some buffet trays empty? Did a poster come off? Is a table wobbly?


- Respect the timing. You are free to designate a "time keeper" among the members of your team who will be responsible for the timed follow-up. Announce the program during the event, and stick to it. Your guests will appreciate having a clear view of the process.


- Be transparent with your audience or with your teams or service providers. A speaker is late? Do you have a technical problem ? Explain it clearly. It is always unpleasant to experience an unforeseen event or to undergo a last minute modification without understanding what is going on.


- Be discreet but available. You will be really demanded, try to be available in case there is a need for you.


- If they could not be anticipated, accept the unexpected. It's part of the event… anything can happen. Act professionally whatever happens, rely on your team and control your emotions. And tell yourself that this is one more lesson to learn for the next event!


## After the Event
****
It's over, the door just closed behind the last guest. You feel a mixture of relief, pride, fatigue…. But now is not the time to release all the pressure. The hardest part is over but save some energy for the final stretch: the post-event phase.
Several objectives allow you to evaluate and close your event:

**Follow up.** Make sure to pay any outstanding bills and follow-up with reimbursements as needed for staff. If you encountered problems, be sure to follow up with those involved and resolve these issues. Save an electronic record of what you did, so those that plan the event in the future will know what you did, save time, and can learn from your challenges.

**Thank.** Partners, participants, speakers, service providers, various helpers,... take the time to thank each of them.

**Share.** Do not hesitate to send to stakeholders all useful and quality content, such as photos or videos of the event, interviews,... to further extend your event. This can be done by email, via your website or social medias. You can also send a report: it's a good way to receive feedbacks from your guests if you didn't already have one.

**Ask.** Involve your participants through polls or satisfaction surveys right after the event. Plan closed questions (general appreciation of the event, of the providers, of the program, etc.) and open questions. This will lead to improvement or real positive points.

**Evaluate your providers.** Follow up on your collaboration with them, in order to capitalize on the best over the long term.

**Analyze.** Take the time to consider the impact and ROI of your event, in relation to your objectives. It is not because everyone had fun that the event is a success. And the reverse is also true. In particular, calculate the absenteeism rate and assess your budget.
Integrate these figures and results into a clear report and share it with everyone involved in organizing your event. Also discuss all the pros and cons of the event place, the different services provided. These are valuable indications for an upcoming event, but also for suppliers and partners.

An event represents such an investment, in terms of time and budget, that it would be a shame not to make the most of it. Continue creating content and share it: articles from your video interviews, videos from the film of the event, quotes from your speakers, photos of the event, articles in the press, etc. This will further help increase awareness of your business.
