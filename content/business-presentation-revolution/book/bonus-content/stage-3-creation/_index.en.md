In the Creation stage, you take the ingredients you found in the Ideation stage, and use the art of storytelling to build a compelling storyline that grabs your audience’s attention, resets it regularly, and communicates your key messages memorably.

The additional resources for this stage should help you to use the pSCORE method to prepare an effective storyline for your presentation.
