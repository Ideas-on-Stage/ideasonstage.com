## Business Presentation Revolution – Bonus Content

Greetings, fellow Business Presentation Revolutionary! If you are looking for additional resources, videos, templates and checklists accompanying the book Business Presentation Revolution by Phil Waknell, you’re in the right place.

If you’ve stumbled upon this page but haven’t yet got the book, you can get a Kindle e-book right now from your local Amazon site, or if you prefer to hold it in your hands, you can order it or find it in most good booksellers.

### Five Stages to Presentation Success

Business Presentation Revolution is structured around the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE for short, a five-stage process that takes you from a blank sheet of paper all the way through to a successful presentation in front of your audience.

You can find the extra resources for each stage on the dedicated pages below. Before getting into pSCORE, you may find it helpful to get an idea of how far along the road to revolutionizing your presentations you’ve already come.
