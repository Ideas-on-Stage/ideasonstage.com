**Business presentations need a revolution, and the revolution needs you. You won’t regret it – and your audiences will thank you.**

## About Business Presentation Revolution

Business Presentation Revolution will be published on July 14th, 2021 – a suitably revolutionary date. It will be available as a paperback and an e-book, and later as an audiobook, narrated by author Phil Waknell.

It features techniques and methods developed and honed by Phil and his colleagues at Ideas on Stage, working with thousands of business presenters, entrepreneurs and TED speakers over the last 11 years.

Covering all stages of the presentation process, from a blank page through to successful delivery in front of your audience, Business Presentation Revolution is packed with stories, techniques and actionable presentation tips that will help you to make a difference every time you speak.

You might also like to check out our [Business Presentation Revolution training courses](/presentations-training/the-business-presentation-revolution/) and keynotes, bringing these methods to life and inspiring your teams to revolutionize their own presentations.

If you’d like to hear more about why we need a revolution, why the world needs another presentation book, and why Phil wrote Business Presentation Revolution, you’ll find the answers in this video podcast also featuring the head of Ideas on Stage USA, Rose Bloomfield.
