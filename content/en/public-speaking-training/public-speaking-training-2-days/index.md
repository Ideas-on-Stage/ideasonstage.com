### Day 1 Program

#### Introduction

- The core of the presentation: the message
- The three pillars of a successful presentation: story, oratory skills, visuals
- Agenda and objectives: presentation of the 2-day training program and objectives
- Participants’ expectations: what do you expect from this training? What specific points would you like to address?

#### Message

- ABC: it’s not your presentation, it’s theirs. Analysis of the Audience, their Need, and the Context
- Transformation objective: what do you want your audience to do after the presentation?
- Information + Emotion = Action: information alone will not trigger action. The presentation must also generate the right emotions.
- Audience Transformation Journey: identify the key messages to communicate during your presentation to reach the goal.

#### Structure

- Choosing a structure: every presentation contains an introduction, a development, and a conclusion. However, the exact structure depends on your objective, audience type, and context. You would not choose the same structure for an Executive Committee meeting as for a sales meeting.
- Place the key messages: based on the chosen structure, learn how to place the key messages identified in the Audience Transformation Journey.
- Complete your structure: add the missing logical elements.
- Connect the elements: finalize the story by linking the elements together to build a simple and engaging narrative thread.

#### Story

- Start strong, finish beautifully: the beginning and the end are the most important moments in a presentation.
- Keep it light: do not hesitate to lighten the content to focus on what is essential.
- Make the problem/need essential: the more important the need, the more it will generate a desire to act.
- Use anecdotes (mini-stories): mini-stories are a very effective way to generate emotion and engagement.
- Personalize and make it unique: how to make your story unique and stand out from others.
- Simplify numbers and data: complexity kills emotion; our goal is to present numbers in a simple, direct, and impactful way.
- Use rhetorical techniques: rhetorical devices like rhetorical questions, repetition, or metaphors can make complex or dry topics much more interesting.
- Borrow credibility: how to use external sources to strengthen credibility.
- Bridge the knowledge gap: ensure the audience has all the necessary elements to understand the presentation.
- Simplify to perfection: presentations can always be simplified further.
- Story checklist

#### Verbal Language

- How to use words and voice to increase presence and convince your audience? This part covers the basic techniques of oratory skills.

#### End-of-Day Exercise

- Prepare a 5-minute presentation and practice the skills learned. Each participant will have 30 to 45 minutes to prepare a complete presentation incorporating all techniques covered during the day, then present it on stage to the group.

#### Conclusion

- Summary of the key points of the day

### Day 2 Program

#### Linking Story and Presentation

- Use a “storyboard”: the storyboard links the prepared story to the PowerPoint slides.
- The pSCORE method: visuals must be Simple, Clear, Original, Related, and Engaging.
Structure Slides
- Cover and final slide: what essential information should be included on these key slides?
- Section slide: how to divide a presentation into sections for better structure and easier audience follow-through?
- Agenda slide: how to create an agenda slide that repeats throughout the presentation?

#### Content Elements

- Title: the difference between a “keyword” title and a “message” title. Is a title necessary on a slide?

- Tables: how to make impactful and easy-to-understand tables?
- Charts: simplify charts to highlight the key message.
- Diagrams and icons: simplify diagrams to make them easier to understand.

- Learn to “own the stage”: when you step on stage, it becomes your space. You set the pace and style.
- Learn body and visual grounding techniques: posture and base stance work for presenters.
- Learn to breathe to speak better: thoracic, abdominal, and complete breathing.

#### Verbal Language

- How to use words and voice to increase presence and convince your audience?

#### Body Language

- Use movement and gestures to add strength and intention to your speech. This part covers gestures to use and avoid during a presentation.
