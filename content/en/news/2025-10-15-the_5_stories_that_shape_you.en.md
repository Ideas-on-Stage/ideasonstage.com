*In this episode, story strategist Amanda Baker shares how leaders and creatives can shape meaningful stories using her 5 Stories method. We explore why personal stories matter, how to overcome fear, and how to build real connection through storytelling.*

What makes a story powerful? Why do so many business leaders struggle to tell their own?

In [this episode of the *Ideas on Stage Podcast*](https://youtu.be/cRUkvU1yCgU), Amanda Baker, story strategist and creator of the 5 Stories method, shares how leaders can reconnect with themselves, communicate with meaning and shape stories that create real connection.

Amanda has coached bestselling authors, TEDx speakers, and purpose-driven founders to turn their truth into powerful narratives. Her message is clear: if you want to make a difference, you need to understand and tell your story.

She explains why our own story is often the hardest to tell – and why it matters most. We often forget our story, suppress it or try to polish it to fit a certain image. But true connection starts when we show up with clarity and honesty.

Amanda breaks down her 5 Stories framework – Origin, Empathy, Purpose, Product and Vision – and explains how each story works, when to use them and why they need to function together. These stories aren't isolated. They’re a living system. They help you speak with clarity, build trust and stay grounded in who you are.

We also talked about fear: how it gets in the way of showing up, and how understanding our relationship with fear is a key part of the process. Amanda’s TEDx talk was shaped around a letter she wrote to fear. That kind of reflection – sitting with your story and facing what holds you back – is what makes story work meaningful.

Amanda also shares personal insights from her own journey: growing up in Reading, selling Nokia phones, directing neighbourhood dance shows as a child, and now balancing the creative life of an entrepreneur and mother. 

Whether you're preparing a keynote, rewriting your website or just trying to show up more authentically, this conversation will help you understand how to shape and share the stories that matter most.
