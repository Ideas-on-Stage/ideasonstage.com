![Confident Presenter book and award](/img/news/website_article_image_book.png "Confident Presenter book")

In 2024, my book, [Confident Presenter](https://www.ideasonstage.com/resources/books/confident-presenter-book/), was awarded **Highly Commended** in the Business Self-Development Book category at the **Business Book Awards**. And it all started with one quote:

*"The book that changes your life is not the one you read, it's the one you write."*

Daniel Priestley shared those words during a business accelerator I attended with Dent, his company. From that moment, the idea of writing a book began to take shape.

As an avid reader, I already knew the power a great book can have. I read 2-3 books a month, and some of them have changed my life. But the thought of being on the other side, as the author? That was intriguing. The challenge of writing something that could leave an impact on others like so many books had done for me was exciting.

**From Manuscript to Published Book**

Writing a book isn't all inspiration and smooth sailing. I’ll never forget when I sent my first manuscript to my beta readers. Their feedback was humbling and incredibly helpful. It’s amazing how much you miss when you’re in the thick of it, and their fresh eyes made all the difference.

The editing process was another game-changer. Working with Rethink Press was a turning point. They helped shape the book into something I’m proud of – it’s 10 times better thanks to them. What could’ve been a long blog post is now a polished book.

**Recognition and Celebration**

Writing a book is hard. It’s not just the time; it’s the mental energy. So, being officially recognised for what I’ve created feels fantastic. Receiving the Highly Commended award is a real honour. I’m grateful for the support I’ve received along the way.

The Business Book Awards event itself was brilliant. It was great to catch up with Natasa Kazmer and Jim Callaghan, who were there with their book *Ready for Takeoff,* as well as Tara Halliday with *Outsmart Imposter Syndrome* and Sarah Farmer with *Leader Unleashed*. I also had the pleasure of meeting the incredible Zareen Roohi Ahmed, whose work is creating a real, lasting impact in the world – truly inspiring. And of course, catching up with my friend, the UK’s number one brand strategist, Sapna Pieroux, was a highlight. The energy in the room was amazing.

**What’s Next?**

Now that this chapter is complete, what’s next? I’m already working on my second book – stay tuned! The journey is far from over, and I can’t wait to see where it leads.
