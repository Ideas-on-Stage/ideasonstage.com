  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does it take to write speeches for a president? In our latest podcast, I had the honour of speaking with </span><strong>Terry Szuplat</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Barack Obama&rsquo;s speechwriter. He shared lessons on public speaking, storytelling and how to connect with an audience in a way that sticks. His advice applies to anyone who wants to communicate with impact &ndash; whether on a big stage or in a small meeting.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Preparation Matters</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry learned from working with Obama that </span><strong>what happens before a speech matters more than what happens on stage</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He uses the </span><strong>50-25-25 rule</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prepare:</span></p>

  <ul>

 <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>50% </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of your time should go into thinking, researching and structuring your message,</span></li>

 <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>25% </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">into writing, and</span></li>
 <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>25%</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into editing and practising.</span></li>

  </ul>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people spend all their time working on slides but forget to prepare and practise. The more time you spend preparing, the more natural and confident you&rsquo;ll feel when speaking.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Cut 15% &ndash; Even If You Think It&rsquo;s Perfect</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry shared a story about Obama asking him to </span><strong>cut a full page from a six-page speech</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just an hour before delivering it. That&rsquo;s </span><strong>15% gone &ndash; without changing the core message</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most speakers try to say too much. A simple way to improve your talk is to </span><strong>go back and cut 15%</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It forces you to focus on what&rsquo;s essential and makes your message clearer.</span></p>

  <p><strong>What You Say Matters More Than How You Say It</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong message is more important than perfect delivery. </span><strong>Body language helps, but it can&rsquo;t fix a weak speech.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People will remember what you say, not whether you had the perfect hand gesture at the right moment.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Start with Energy, End with Hope</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great way to connect with an audience? </span><strong>Start by saying hello &ndash; with energy.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&rsquo;s simple, and it works. People respond when you show up fully engaged.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when you finish, </span><strong>leave your audience with hope</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether you&rsquo;re leading a team, pitching an idea or giving a talk, people need to believe that the change you&rsquo;re proposing is possible.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Tell One Story, Not a List of Numbers</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People don&rsquo;t connect with data &ndash; they connect with stories. Instead of sharing a long list of statistics, </span><strong>tell the story of one person</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Research shows we care more about a single, specific story than about big numbers. Whether in business, leadership or fundraising, storytelling is the most effective way to get people to listen and act.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Speaking Well Is a Skill &ndash; Not a Talent</strong></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key takeaway from our conversation is that </span><strong>public speaking is something you learn, not something you&rsquo;re born with.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even Obama had to work at it. Early in his career, he struggled. He got better by practising, getting feedback and refining his message over time.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter your starting point, you can improve. And as Terry reminds us, </span><strong>your voice matters</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
