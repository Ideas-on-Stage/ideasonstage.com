Storytelling is a powerful way to connect with others, especially in business. If you want to attract the right clients, learning how to tell your story can make all the difference.

**Why Storytelling Matters**

Stories help you connect emotionally with your audience. They build trust and show the real you. By sharing your story, you attract clients who resonate with your values and vision. As Susan Payton says, “Before people buy from you, they need to buy into you.” 

**Susan’s Story: From Struggle to Success**

In 2015, Susan started a community for women in business. While the group was active, she struggled to turn that engagement into a business. One evening, feeling lost, she decided to share her personal story with the group. She talked about the challenges she faced as a single mom, the financial setbacks from the 2008 crash, and her journey to find her purpose.

This honest sharing resonated deeply with the group. Women started reaching out, connecting with her story, and wanting to work with her. In just six weeks, Susan gained several clients — proving the power of authentic storytelling.

**Understanding Your Value**

One key to effective storytelling is knowing the value you bring to your clients. If you don’t clearly communicate how you can help them, even the best story won’t lead to engagement. Susan stresses the importance of understanding the impact you can have on your clients' lives.

**The Role of a Guide**

In storytelling, especially in business, you’re not the hero — your client is. Your role is to be the guide who helps them achieve their goals. This shift in focus can change how you communicate and connect with your audience.

**Everyone Has a Story**

Many people think their stories aren’t interesting, but Susan believes everyone’s story has value. You’ve overcome challenges and gained unique insights. These experiences make your story worth sharing.

**Three Types of Stories**

Susan breaks down storytelling into three main types:

* **Personal Stories**: These show who you are and help people connect with you on a personal level.
* **Business Stories**: These explain what your business stands for and why it exists.
* **Customer Stories**: These focus on understanding your clients’ needs and how you can help them.

**Avoiding Common Mistakes**

Some common mistakes in storytelling include:

* Making the message too complex.
* Assuming you know what your audience wants without really understanding them.
* Overthinking the marketing aspect and hesitating to share your story.

Susan encourages keeping it simple and authentic. Share your journey to connect with potential clients without feeling like you’re pushing a sales pitch.
