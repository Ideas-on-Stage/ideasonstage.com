*Finance director Ciaran O’Donnell shares how improving his communication skills transformed both his confidence and his business. From his first LinkedIn video to leading with storytelling and presence, Ciaran’s journey shows how clear communication can build trust, attract clients and create lasting impact.*

When Ciaran O’Donnell launched Virtual FD in 2010, his focus was clear: help growing businesses get Finance Director–level advice before they could afford a full-time hire. As a qualified accountant and experienced finance professional, he had all the technical skills he needed. What he didn’t expect was that **communication would become one of the most valuable parts of his work.**

By 2020, Ciaran had already advised more than a hundred startups and fast-growth companies. His reputation was built on trust and results. Then lockdown came, and like many others, he found himself communicating almost entirely online. That’s when he realised that **technical knowledge alone wasn’t enough** – how he shaped and delivered his message mattered just as much.

It started with a simple LinkedIn video. Ciaran recorded it at his desk, posted it and received kind comments. But when he watched it back, he saw filler words and weak structure. He also saw potential. Around the same time, his young daughter took part in a school poetry competition – shy, nervous, yet brave enough to stand on stage. That moment stayed with him. If she could do it, so could he.

Ciaran joined one of our sessions at Ideas on Stage and began learning practical tools to speak with clarity and confidence. He stopped memorising every word and started *internalising* his message. He discovered frameworks to help audiences care. He learned to pause, breathe and use silence to hold attention.

From there came his “beach talks” – short videos recorded by the sea while his children were at ballet class. Over time, these talks helped him find his authentic voice. Viewers began to see more than a finance expert; they saw a storyteller who made business relatable.

Five years later, the results speak for themselves. Ciaran now feels at ease presenting to clients, leading events, and even giving a speech to 100 guests at his 50th birthday – a moment that once would have filled him with nerves. His communication skills have also had a tangible impact on his business. As he says, **“Ninety percent of the fees I earn this year come from people who gravitated towards me because of me telling stories.”**

Ciaran’s journey shows what happens when a professional chooses to grow beyond their technical expertise. By improving his communication, he strengthened his relationships, expanded his reach and found new confidence in sharing his ideas.

And that’s what becoming a better speaker truly means.
