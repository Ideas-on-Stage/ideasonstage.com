  <p class="p1"><strong>Transcript</strong></p>

  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Guy, welcome to the show!</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Thank you for having me, Andrea.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Guy, in your new book <em>Think Remarkable</em>, you talk about how important teachers are and how they might not see the full impact of their work. I just wanted to tell you that you&rsquo;ve been one of those teachers for me since my university days. Thank you.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Oh, thank you, Andrea.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Let&rsquo;s dive into your book. Can you define what you mean by "remarkable"?&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Remarkable means making a difference, contributing to making the world a better place. It&rsquo;s not about becoming rich or famous; it&rsquo;s about contributing positively to society. My book is <em>Think Remarkable</em>, not <em>Think Rich</em>, and my podcast is <em>Remarkable People</em>, not <em>Rich People</em>. The focus is on the impact you make.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> You also mention that for remarkable people, being remarkable isn&rsquo;t the objective.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Yes, remarkable people don&rsquo;t wake up thinking, "How can I be remarkable today?" They focus on making a difference, whether it&rsquo;s through their work, helping others, or improving their own lives. Remarkability is a byproduct of their contributions, not the goal.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Your book is structured into three sections: Growth, Grit, and Grace. Can you give us an overview of these stages?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Sure. These stages represent the journey to becoming remarkable. Growth is about learning and evolving, Grit is about perseverance and determination, and Grace is about giving back and doing things with humility. These stages are based on insights from the remarkable people I&rsquo;ve interviewed.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> I&rsquo;d like to jump straight into the Grace stage, which resonated the most with me. You talk about fulfilling your "success oblige." What does that mean?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> "Success oblige" is similar to the concept of "noblesse oblige," but instead of nobility, it&rsquo;s about the obligation that comes with success. When you become successful, you have a moral obligation to help others and contribute to society. It&rsquo;s about using your success to make the world a better place.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> You also suggest that as we grow, we should change how we measure success. Can you elaborate on that?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Yes, as you mature, your criteria for success should evolve. Early in life, success might be about accumulating wealth or achieving status. But as you grow, it should be more about the impact you have on others and the legacy you leave behind.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> I loved your idea that instead of focusing on making the right decisions, we should focus on making decisions right. Can you explain this concept?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Absolutely. It&rsquo;s more important to make the most of the decisions you make rather than obsessing over making the perfect decision. Once you&rsquo;ve made a decision, commit to it, and do everything you can to make it successful.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> And what&rsquo;s the connection to surfing, which you use as an analogy?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> In surfing, you&rsquo;re often searching for the perfect wave, but once you catch one, you have to make the most of it, even if it&rsquo;s not perfect. The same applies to decisions &ndash; you need to make them work for you, no matter the circumstances.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> You also talk about the importance of being in a growth mindset environment, not just having a growth mindset. Why is that environment so crucial?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> A growth mindset is personal, but it&rsquo;s also essential to be in an environment that supports growth. If you&rsquo;re in a place that discourages learning and trying new things, it&rsquo;s hard to maintain a growth mindset. The right environment nurtures and reinforces growth.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> There&rsquo;s also a counterintuitive idea in your book about envy. You say that envy, often seen as negative, can actually be a good thing. How so?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Envy itself isn&rsquo;t bad &ndash; it&rsquo;s how you respond to it that matters. If envy motivates you to improve yourself or achieve more, it can be a positive force. It&rsquo;s about channelling envy into productive actions.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> You mention the quote, "Sometimes you win, sometimes you grow." Tell me more.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> The idea is that even when you don&rsquo;t win, you can still grow. Failure isn&rsquo;t the end; it&rsquo;s an opportunity to learn and improve. This mindset turns every experience into a chance for growth.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> A related concept is the idea of planting many seeds instead of focusing on one or two things. Why is that important?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Success isn&rsquo;t guaranteed, so it&rsquo;s smart to try many things &ndash; plant many seeds. Some will fail, but some will flourish. By diversifying your efforts, you increase your chances of success.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> As a small business owner, what areas should entrepreneurs like me focus on to increase our chances of success?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> One critical area is leveraging AI in your business. Just like having an internet presence became essential 20 years ago, today, understanding and using AI is crucial. It&rsquo;s a tool that can significantly impact your business.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> You also suggest starting a career in sales. How does that connect to what we&rsquo;ve been discussing?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Sales is one of the most valuable skills you can develop. Whether you&rsquo;re selling a product, an idea, or yourself, learning how to sell is essential for success. It&rsquo;s a skill that applies to almost every aspect of life.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Finally, Guy, if someone wants to learn more about you and your work, where should they go?</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> They can check out my podcast, <em>Remarkable People</em>, my Substack newsletter, or follow me on LinkedIn and Threads.</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Andrea Pacini:</strong> Guy, thank you so much for sharing your insights. I look forward to having you back when your next book comes out!</p>
  <p class="p1"><strong>Guy Kawasaki:</strong> Thank you, Andrea. It&rsquo;s been a pleasure.</p>
