*In this episode, Graham Allcott shares how kindness can drive performance, build trust and shape strong workplace cultures. We explore the difference between kindness and niceness, the ROI of empathy and practical ways leaders can embed kindness into how they lead.*

In [this episode of the Ideas on Stage Podcast](https://youtu.be/3B2XLdCjGFI), productivity expert and author Graham Allcott shares how kindness – often dismissed or misunderstood – can be a powerful force in leadership, culture and performance.

Graham’s latest book, *KIND: The Quiet Power of Kindness at Work*, challenges traditional thinking about what drives results in modern organisations. 

**What Kindness Really Means**

Kindness is not the same as being nice. That distinction matters.

Being “nice” often means avoiding conflict, keeping people comfortable or pretending everything is fine. True kindness, Graham says, involves honesty, courage and the willingness to have hard conversations – while still showing care and respect.

Kindness isn’t soft. It takes strength. And when leaders embrace it, they create workplaces where people feel safe, seen and supported.

**The ROI of Kindness**

Why does kindness matter at work? Because it works.

Graham explains that kindness builds trust – an essential ingredient for good decision-making, long-term performance and psychological safety. Kind teams are more engaged, more resilient and more likely to stay.

He shares practical examples and research that show how kindness leads to better outcomes for people and businesses alike.

**Start Small. Think Big.**

Graham shares a story from Naples about *caffè sospeso*, a tradition where you buy a coffee for someone you’ll never meet. It’s a small act, but it creates a ripple effect. The same is true at work: small, generous choices – made consistently – can transform a culture.

Graham also outlines eight principles of “kindfulness at work,” including:

* Kindness starts with you
* People first. Work second. Always.
* Slow down. Kindness takes time.
* It doesn’t end with you – leaders must build systems that support kindness

**What Kind Leadership Looks Like**

We also talked about what a kind organisation could look like 10 years from now. From hiring and onboarding to feedback and decision-making, Graham encourages leaders to ask: “What would this look like if we led with kindness?”

He also shared stories of companies like Timpson and examples of leaders who put people before processes – and still deliver results.

**Final Thoughts**

This episode is a reminder that leadership doesn’t have to be loud to be strong. Kindness can feel quiet – but its impact runs deep.

Whether you lead a team or shape culture in your organisation, this conversation will give you tools and inspiration to lead with more humanity.
