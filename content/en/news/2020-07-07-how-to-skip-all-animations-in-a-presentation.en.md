Do animations in a presentation make you feel seasick? Animations in PowerPoint are great, until they aren't. A small dose of animation is fine, but presentations with too many animations can be cumbersome to watch in presenter mode.

Luckily, PowerPoint offers a simple functionality to disable all animations in one go. In the ribbon, go to the "Slide Show" tab, then click on "Set up Slide Show". Then simply tick the box "show without animation". Now all animations will be gone. It does not, however, disable slide transitions, so if you use a fade or magic move between slides, they will still show.
