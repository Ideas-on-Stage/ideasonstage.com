*In this special masterclass, Julian Treasure – international speaker and TED Talk legend – explores how listening shapes the way we speak. He shares practical tools to help leaders and professionals become better listeners, stronger communicators and more impactful speakers.*

On July 2, we hosted a special live session with Julian Treasure, one of the world’s leading experts on communication. Julian is known for his TED Talk *“How to speak so that people want to listen,”* which has been viewed over 60 million times. But in this session, he focused on a skill many overlook: listening.



**Listening shapes how we speak**

Julian opened with a powerful message: if you want to speak well, you need to listen well. Listening, he said, is the foundation of all effective communication – whether you're speaking to one person or thousands.

He explained that communication doesn’t work in a straight line. Speaking and listening influence each other. The way we speak affects how people listen, and the way people listen affects how we speak. This cycle happens within a specific context – and that context matters.

### **The listening you’re speaking into**

One of the key takeaways from the session was this question: 

**“What’s the listening I’m speaking into?”**

Every person listens differently. We all filter what we hear through our culture, values, beliefs, emotions and assumptions. These filters shape our reality and create a unique listening experience for each of us.

Julian encouraged everyone to stop assuming that people listen the same way they do. When we ignore this, we risk speaking into a listening that doesn’t exist. Effective communicators learn to sense the listening in the room and adapt their message accordingly.

### **Why listening matters**

Julian outlined several reasons why we must pay attention to listening:

* **It improves leadership.** Leaders who listen build trust, morale and stronger teams. Yet only 8% of employees in a LinkedIn study said their leaders listen well.


* **It reduces costly miscommunication.** In the US alone, miscommunication costs businesses over $1 trillion per year *(State of Business Communication, The Harris Poll, 2021)*.


* **It keeps people engaged.** Poor listening leads to disengagement, which costs the global economy even more – an estimated $8.8 trillion a year *(State of The Global Workplace, Gallup 2023).*


* **It strengthens relationships.** Listening creates connection. Without it, relationships weaken – at work, at home, and across society.


* **It helps us learn and influence.** Listening is essential for learning and for persuading others.


* **It makes us more aware.** When we listen consciously, we notice how sound affects our bodies, emotions, focus and decisions.



### **Four steps to improve your listening**

To help people listen better, Julian shared four practical steps:

1. **Be conscious.** Know that listening is an active skill, not a passive ability. Ask yourself, “Where’s the best place I could listen from right now?”


2. **Commit.** Give your full attention when it matters. Multitasking during a serious conversation breaks trust.


3. **Show compassion and curiosity.** Listen to understand, not to judge. Treat every person as someone you can learn from.


4. **Use the PAVE method.** *Paraphrase* what you heard. *Admit* the speaker’s experience as valid. *Validate* their point of view. *Empathise* with their emotions.



### **What next?**

Julian ended with a reminder: the listening you speak into is always changing. Great communicators ask, sense and adapt – every time.
