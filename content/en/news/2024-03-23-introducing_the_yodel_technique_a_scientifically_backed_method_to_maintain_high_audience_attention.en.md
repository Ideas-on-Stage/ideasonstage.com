  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many years, we've said that your audience's attention is like sand in an hourglass. Sooner or later, no matter how entertaining you are, the attention will run out, and it's not up to them to make an effort to listen: it's up to you to reset their attention regularly, turning over that hourglass before it runs out.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now following successful trials in Switzerland, Ideas on Stage is proud to bring you a completely new and original way to reset their attention: </span><strong>the YODEL Technique&trade;.</strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on centuries of Swiss tradition, the YODEL Technique&trade; is simple to use, takes your audience by surprise, and is guaranteed to wake them up.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've never heard of yodelling, check out this short video of voice coach </span><a href="https://www.jimmycannon.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Cannon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, demonstrating this impressive vocal technique.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting it into practice is straightforward. Every ten minutes or so, pause your presentation, take a deep breath, and yodel loudly for several seconds. Then, recap what you said in the previous ten minutes, and move on. This is grounded in science: wake people up, reset their attention, remind them what they heard before moving on, and they will remember so much more.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&rsquo;ve tested the YODEL&trade; Technique in partnership with the </span><strong>First Applied Psychological Research Institute (Lausanne)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and results are extremely encouraging. When audiences get over the initial surprise, they find it engaging, but what is more important is that they remember 30% more than in our control experiment, which instead reset their attention using funny cat videos, and 80% more than the baseline, which was a simple presentation without any attempt to reset the audience's attention.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s not necessary to wear traditional Swiss mountain dress to use the YODEL Technique&trade;, but you will certainly make more of an impression if you do.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So next time you need to keep people's attention, remember the YODEL Technique&trade; &ndash; which can become Your Original, Daring, Entertaining Leadership style. After watches, chocolate and cheese, this is the next best thing to come out of Switzerland.</span></p>
