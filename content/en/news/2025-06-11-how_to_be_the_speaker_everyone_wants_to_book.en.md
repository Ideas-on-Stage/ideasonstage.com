Mark Denton knows what it means to lead in uncertain conditions. Twenty-five years ago, he led a team of non-professionals in one of the world’s toughest yacht races, sailing against the spin of the earth, facing harsh weather, fatigue and the constant need to adapt. The experience taught him lessons about leadership, teamwork and resilience – lessons he has since shared with business leaders and professional audiences around the world.

Last year, Mark won the *Booker's Choice* award at the Speaker Awards, a recognition from speaker bureaus that see thousands of speakers every year. This award reinforced what has made him a sought-after speaker: his ability to tell a compelling story while delivering practical lessons that matter to organisations today.

In my recent conversation with Mark, we discussed what makes a speaker more bookable and how to stand out in a crowded market.

**The Power of a Clear Message**

One of Mark’s key points was the importance of clarity. Event organisers and speaker bureaus need speakers who are clear, reliable and easy to promote. They look for someone who delivers a great talk and also makes their job easier. Speakers who try to cover too many topics struggle to stand out. Mark learned this firsthand when he refined his positioning from a broad message about leadership and teamwork to a focused theme: “Navigate the Storm.”

He emphasised the need for speakers to know their lane – what they stand for, who they serve and why their message matters. This clarity makes it easier for speaker bureaus and event organisers to trust them, knowing exactly where they fit into an event.

**Building a Speaking Business**

Despite being represented by many speaker bureaus, Mark explained that only about 20% of speaking engagements come through agencies. The remaining 80% come from direct outreach and referrals. He stressed the importance of staying in touch with past clients and building strong relationships.

His marketing approach includes leveraging LinkedIn, maintaining relationships with past clients and ensuring that every engagement is a chance to generate more business. His advice for aspiring speakers: never rely solely on one source of business. Speakers need to take control of their own marketing and not assume that great opportunities will just come their way.

**Keeping the Speech Fresh**

When a speaker delivers the same presentation many times a year, there’s a risk of becoming disengaged. Mark avoids this by treating each event as its own challenge. He customises his talk based on the audience, their industry and the specific themes of the event. He compares his speech to a donut: the main structure stays the same, but the content in the middle shifts to fit the audience.

This approach keeps his talks relevant and ensures that every audience gets an experience tailored to their needs. His mindset? The real measure of success is the impact a speaker creates. A strong presentation leads to action, change or a lasting impression. The moment a speaker stops focusing on that, their effectiveness drops.

**Selling from the Stage (Without Selling)**

Mark believes that the best marketing happens on stage. When an audience is moved by a talk, they will spread the word, leading to more bookings and referrals. He also shared a smart technique for gathering testimonials. Instead of simply asking for feedback at the end, he makes it part of the experience by tying it to a story he shares during his talk. 

In the story, he describes a key moment during a race when the two teams he was leading had to share their challenges with each other to move forward. He then connects this idea to his own challenge as a speaker – getting reviews. By framing his request as part of that narrative, he creates a natural moment of engagement. 

He reinforces this by displaying a QR code on screen, making it easy for the audience to leave a review instantly. The feedback is then uploaded automatically to his website, ensuring a seamless way to collect and showcase testimonials.

**What Makes a Speaker Bookable?**

Beyond a strong message and polished delivery, Mark highlighted the importance of being easy to work with. Event organisers want speakers who are reliable, professional, and stress-free to deal with. Responsiveness, clear pricing and a no-hassle approach to logistics make a big difference.

Another key factor is repeatability. Mark shared that most speakers need 300-400 inquiries a year to book 50-75 gigs. This means having a system in place to generate consistent opportunities – whether through bureaus, past clients or direct outreach.

**Final Thoughts**

Mark’s parting advice for anyone looking to build a successful speaking career was simple: focus on the client. A great speaker solves a problem for the audience and the event organiser. Those who keep this in mind will always be in demand.

Mark also shared many other practical insights for speakers who want to get hired more often and increase their value. If you want to learn more, **[watch the full interview.](https://youtu.be/d4XYElBqEVw)**
