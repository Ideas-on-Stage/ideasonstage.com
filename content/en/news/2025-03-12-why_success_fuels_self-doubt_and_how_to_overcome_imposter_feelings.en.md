    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many high achievers believe that success will silence self-doubt. But what if the opposite is true? What if the more we accomplish, the more likely we are to feel like we don&rsquo;t belong?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recently had the pleasure of interviewing </span><strong>Dr. Jill Stoddard</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, TEDx speaker, psychologist, and author of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imposter No More</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We explored why so many people &ndash; even those at the top of their game &ndash; struggle with imposter feelings, and how leaders can create cultures that encourage vulnerability and self-compassion.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the key takeaways from our conversation.</span></p>
    <p><strong>It&rsquo;s Not &ldquo;Imposter Syndrome&rdquo; &ndash; And Here&rsquo;s Why That Matters</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill makes an important distinction: she doesn&rsquo;t call it </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">imposter syndrome</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead, she prefers </span><strong>imposter phenomenon</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong>imposterism</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; and for good reason.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">syndrome</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests a disorder, something broken that needs to be fixed. But imposter feelings aren&rsquo;t a disease. Research shows that up to </span><strong>70% of people</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience them at some point in their lives. If most of us feel this way, then it&rsquo;s not a pathology &ndash; it&rsquo;s part of being human.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here&rsquo;s another crucial point: imposter feelings may be more common in </span><strong>marginalised groups</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If society has repeatedly told someone they don&rsquo;t belong, it makes sense that they might internalise that doubt. Instead of treating imposterism as a personal flaw, we need to recognize the </span><strong>systemic barriers</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that contribute to it.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Why Success Makes Self-Doubt Worse, Not Better</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most surprising insights from Jill&rsquo;s research is that </span><strong>success doesn&rsquo;t eliminate imposter feelings &ndash; it increases them</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because the higher you climb, the </span><strong>more you feel expected to know and prove yourself</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jill compares it to Oscar winners who, instead of feeling validated by their achievement, feel even more pressure to live up to expectations.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a deeper level, this is an evolutionary trait. Early humans relied on social groups for survival. Being accepted by the group meant staying alive. This fear of rejection still exists today. We worry about </span><strong>whether we belong, whether we measure up, and whether we&rsquo;re at risk of being &ldquo;found out.&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But trying to outrun imposter feelings through </span><strong>constant achievement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn&rsquo;t work. It only fuels </span><strong>burnout</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of chasing external validation, we need a different approach.</span></p>
    <p><strong>The Alternative: Psychological Flexibility</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill doesn&rsquo;t offer a cure for imposter feelings &ndash; because there isn&rsquo;t one. Instead, she introduces </span><strong>psychological flexibility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ability to:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be present in the moment</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept uncomfortable thoughts and feelings</span></li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take action based on values, not fear</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means </span><strong>not waiting until you feel confident to act</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jill shared how she pushed through </span><strong>crippling self-doubt</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before her TEDx talk &ndash; not by getting rid of the fear, but by showing up </span><strong>despite it</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Hold Outcomes Lightly &ndash; But Take Action Boldly</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill&rsquo;s TEDx talk introduces a powerful concept: </span><strong>holding outcomes lightly</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals matter, but we don&rsquo;t always control the outcome. For example, an author can write the best book possible, but whether it becomes a bestseller depends on many factors outside their control.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what&rsquo;s the alternative? </span><strong>Stay focused on what you can control.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Show up, do the work, and take action based on what matters to you. Success is not just about </span><strong>reaching the goal</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but also about </span><strong>the journey itself</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><strong>The Role of Leaders: Model Vulnerability</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders play a critical role in shaping environments where people feel safe to </span><strong>embrace self-doubt</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of hiding it. The most powerful thing a leader can do? </span><strong>Model it themselves.</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When leaders share their own imposter experiences, they give permission for others to do the same. This shifts the culture from one of </span><strong>perfectionism and fear</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to one of </span><strong>growth and self-compassion</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill reminds us that </span><strong>everyone feels imposter thoughts at some point &ndash; even the most successful people.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The difference is whether we let those thoughts hold us back or keep moving forward despite them.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Final Thought: Find Your &ldquo;O&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Jill&rsquo;s favorite strategies is </span><strong>asking yourself: &ldquo;What would my O do?&rdquo;</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your &ldquo;O&rdquo; is a role model &ndash; someone you admire. It could be a mentor, a public figure, or even a fictional character. When self-doubt creeps in, ask: </span><strong>&ldquo;What would they do?&rdquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then, do that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill&rsquo;s &ldquo;O&rdquo; is Oprah. When she doubted herself before her TEDx talk, she imagined Oprah telling her: </span><strong>&ldquo;You have a message to share. You must do this.&rdquo;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That mindset shift helped her push forward, even in the presence of fear.</span></p>
