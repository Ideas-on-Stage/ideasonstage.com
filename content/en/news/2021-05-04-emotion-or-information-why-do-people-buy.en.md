Have you already experienced the situation where you are trying to close a big sale, your prospect is satisfied with your explanations, but he always postpones the final signature. Why? What does he need to take the final decision? Information or emotion?

Well, I’m going to cheat, it’s both. The decision-making process relies on both emotion and information. But if I really had to keep only one, it would be emotion. Why? Because emotions are what triggers the decision, and information is there to help us rationalize our decision.

Not convinced? You think we are rational beings, and that emotion only plays a small part in the decision-making process? Let me give you a few examples.

In today’s market, when you want to buy a car, the real problem is not to find a reliable one or a model that suits our needs. It’s to decide which one to buy among the plethora of suitable choices. And how do we take the final decision? Emotion. It’s about which car is going to best fit our self-image … or our significant other’s self-image. And I’m not even going to analyze why we buy sports cars with a top speed of 300 kph when all we can do is stroll around at 120 kph…

Let’s take another example: wine. During blind tests, people don’t rank tasted wines according to prestige or price. Yet, when *the same wine* is served from a prestigious bottle, it is consistently rated higher than the exact same wine poured from a less known bottle. Why? Because our emotions affect our senses. In sales, ignoring emotions is ignoring how to win.

Finally, let me take a last example: financial bubbles. These happen when very, very rational people get carried over by … their emotions. Don’t get fooled: the world of finance is run by humans, and these humans are subject to emotions too. Someone said, “Investors prefer being wrong with the crowd than taking the risk of being right alone.”

In my experience, salespeople with a high education level tend to underestimate the role of emotions in the decision-making process. If you are trying to close a big sale, for example a big consulting project or IT project, and come from the rational school of thought, you might base your presentation only on factual elements. But your prospect’s decisions are never purely analytic, they mix emotions and information. So to close the sale, think about bringing the wow factor into your next presentation.
