  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to present data in your work, chances are you've used a chart or graph that didn&rsquo;t quite land. Maybe it looked fine, but the message didn&rsquo;t come through. Or maybe your audience didn&rsquo;t know what to focus on.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent session with Dr Jonathan Schwabish, over 200 professionals joined us to learn how to avoid these problems. Jonathan is a leading voice in data communication, and his session was full of useful examples and simple strategies anyone can apply.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the key ideas he shared:</span></p>
  <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t let your software decide for you</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people rely on dropdown menus in Excel or PowerPoint. But charts made by default settings rarely do a good job. Instead, choose your visuals based on what you want your audience to understand.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan showed two different ways of presenting the same information about Taylor Swift&rsquo;s net worth. One was a block of text. The other used coloured beads &ndash; like the friendship bracelets fans exchange at her concerts &ndash; to represent the data visually.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It worked not because it was flashy, but because it connected with the audience and made the numbers easier to grasp. You don&rsquo;t need beads, but you </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go beyond bar charts and pie charts. Be thoughtful about how you show your message.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Help your audience see what matters</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan showed how our brains quickly notice differences in colour, shape, size and position. These are called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-attentive attributes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use them to guide people&rsquo;s attention. Make the key point stand out by changing the thickness of a line, adding a highlight or turning everything else grey.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everything stands out, nothing does.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Start with the audience, not the chart</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start designing, ask: Who is going to see this? What do they know already? What do they need from it? A chart for expert analysts will look different from one shown in a team meeting or client pitch. The audience should guide every decision.</span></p>
  <p><strong>Use these five simple strategies</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan shared five core ideas to improve any chart or graph:</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Show the data.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make the message clear. Don&rsquo;t hide it under layers of design or decoration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Reduce the clutter.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Get rid of anything that doesn&rsquo;t help the viewer understand the point &ndash; like heavy borders, 3D effects or unnecessary grid lines.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Integrate text and visuals.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use clear titles that tell people what they should learn from the chart. Label things directly &ndash; don&rsquo;t make people look back and forth between the chart and a legend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Try small multiples.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead of one chart with everything crammed into it, split it into smaller charts that show one idea at a time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Start with grey.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make everything the same colour and weight at first. Then highlight the part you want people to notice. If your eyes don&rsquo;t go to the right place, something needs to change.&nbsp;</span></li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>One rule to follow</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">There aren&rsquo;t many hard rules in data visualisation, but Jonathan shared one you should always stick to: </span><strong>bar charts must start at zero</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If they don&rsquo;t, you risk misleading people. You make the difference between two values look bigger than it really is.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He gave a simple example: a chart comparing his height to his son&rsquo;s. If the bars start at his son&rsquo;s height instead of zero, it makes it look like his son doesn&rsquo;t exist. The visual exaggerates the difference and completely misrepresents the data.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting at zero avoids exaggerating small differences. It keeps the visual representation accurate.</span></p>
  <p><strong>One final takeaway</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design with purpose. Think about what you want people to see and remember &ndash; and build everything around that.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan ended by reminding us: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&rsquo;t need fancy tools to do this well.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even Excel can work just fine if you&rsquo;re thoughtful about what you're showing, and why.</span></p>
