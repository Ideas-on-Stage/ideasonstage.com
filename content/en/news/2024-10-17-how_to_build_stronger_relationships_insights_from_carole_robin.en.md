In a recent podcast interview with Carole Robin, Ph.D., we discussed the value of building exceptional relationships. Carole, co-author of *Connect* and a former Stanford professor, shared practical advice that can improve your personal and professional lives.

**Key Takeaways from Our Conversation:**

* **Understanding Relationship Types:** Relationships can range from casual contacts to deep, exceptional connections. While not every relationship needs to be exceptional, focusing on strong, functional ones can make a big difference in your life.
* **The 15% Rule:** When sharing personal information, push slightly outside your comfort zone — about 15%. This helps build trust without overwhelming anyone.
* **Characteristics of Exceptional Relationships:** These relationships involve mutual understanding, trust, honesty, productive conflict resolution, and a commitment to each other’s growth.
* **Clean Communication:** Clear and specific communication is crucial. Carole shared a story about how this approach helped her children resolve a conflict, showing the importance of being direct and constructive.
* **Turning Conflict into Growth:** Conflict doesn’t have to be harmful. If handled thoughtfully, it can strengthen relationships, similar to the Japanese art of Kintsugi, where broken pottery is repaired and made more beautiful.

These are just a few of the insights Carole shared. To learn more about her strategies for building stronger relationships, I encourage you to [**watch the full interview**.](https://youtu.be/wN7MO6IpMRI)
