  <p class="p1">When people think about improvisation, they often imagine actors on a stage making things up on the spot. But Patricia Ryan Madson, author of <em>Improv Wisdom: Don&rsquo;t Prepare, Just Show Up</em>, has spent decades showing that improvisation is much more than a performance tool &ndash; it&rsquo;s a way of thinking that can transform the way we communicate.</p>
  <p class="p1">In our conversation on the <a href="https://www.ideasonstage.com/resources/podcast/"><span class="s1"><strong>Ideas on Stage Podcast</strong></span></a>, Patricia shared how improv principles can help anyone become a better speaker, presenter and communicator. She has taught at Stanford University, worked with some of the world&rsquo;s top companies, and distilled her wisdom into 13 maxims that encourage people to embrace spontaneity, handle uncertainty and trust themselves.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>Prepare, Then Let Go</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">The subtitle of her book, <em>Don&rsquo;t Prepare, Just Show Up</em>, might sound like a direct challenge to what many presentation coaches &ndash; including us &ndash; teach. But as Patricia explained, preparation is important, but it shouldn&rsquo;t get in the way of being fully present.</p>
  <p class="p1">"Prepare, prepare, prepare &ndash; of course," she said. "But when you step up to speak, don&rsquo;t just present your package. Be there, 100%."</p>
  <p class="p1">Some speakers over-rehearse to the point that they become stiff and disconnected from their audience. They focus so much on delivering their prepared words that they forget to engage in the moment. The best speakers, Patricia argues, trust that their preparation is there in the background and allow themselves to respond to the room.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>Performance Anxiety and Self-Focus</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">One of the most powerful insights from our conversation was Patricia&rsquo;s take on stage fright. She believes performance anxiety often comes from excessive self-focus.</p>
  <p class="p1">"If you&rsquo;re thinking, &lsquo;I hope they like me, I hope I don&rsquo;t mess up,&rsquo; your attention is on yourself instead of where it should be &ndash; on your audience."</p>
  <p class="p1">Shifting that focus outward changes everything. Instead of worrying about how you&rsquo;re coming across, focus on serving your audience. What do they need? What will help them? This simple shift reduces anxiety and makes a speaker more engaging.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>Saying Yes to the Unexpected</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">In improvisation, a core principle is <strong>saying yes</strong> &ndash; not just in the literal sense but in accepting and working with whatever happens. Patricia shared how this applies to public speaking.</p>
  <p class="p1">When things don&rsquo;t go as planned &ndash; a tech failure, an unexpected question or a noisy room &ndash; many speakers freeze or panic. Instead, improv teaches us to acknowledge reality and move forward.</p>
  <p class="p1">"If you&rsquo;re setting up for a talk and the room is too hot, acknowledge it. If a question catches you off guard, take a moment, think about it and respond honestly. Even saying 'I don&rsquo;t know' can be a great answer. Saying yes means working with what&rsquo;s in front of you instead of resisting it."</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>The Value of Mistakes</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">Patricia also reframes mistakes as something valuable rather than something to avoid. She told a story about a high-profile speaking event where she mistimed her cue and walked on stage too early. Instead of panicking, she simply walked back to her seat and waited. When she took the stage at the right moment, the audience smiled, recognising her human moment.</p>
  <p class="p1">People don&rsquo;t admire perfection. They admire how you handle imperfection.</p>
  <p class="p1">Mistakes show authenticity. They remind the audience that a speaker is human. More importantly, they often create opportunities for connection.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>Be Average &ndash; And Do Better</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">One of the most surprising ideas Patricia shared was the power of aiming to <em>be average</em>. Many presenters strive for perfection, but that pursuit often leads to stress, hesitation and inaction.</p>
  <p class="p1">"When you try too hard to be perfect, you tense up, second-guess yourself and lose your natural flow," she explained. "But when you aim to be average &ndash; to just do the best you can with what you have &ndash; you take the pressure off, and paradoxically, you often do much better."</p>
  <p class="p1">She shared a story about her group of friends who held 'Bad Art Night,' where the goal was to create something intentionally imperfect. Without the pressure of making something great, they ended up producing some of their best work.</p>
  <p class="p1">For presenters, this means letting go of the need to be flawless and instead focusing on clear, genuine communication.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>The Four A&rsquo;s of Improv</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">Patricia has distilled her 13 maxims into four guiding principles:</p>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li1"><strong>Attention</strong> &ndash; Noticing what&rsquo;s happening in the moment.</li>
    <li class="li1"><strong>Acceptance</strong> &ndash; Embracing whatever comes your way.</li>
    <li class="li1"><strong>Appreciation</strong> &ndash; Recognising the value in every situation.</li>
    <li class="li1"><strong>Action</strong> &ndash; Responding based on what&rsquo;s needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="p1">She believes these four steps apply to both life and communication. A great speaker pays attention to the room, accepts the circumstances, appreciates the opportunity and then acts accordingly.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>A Practical First Step</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">For those wanting to build their improv muscles, Patricia suggests a simple exercise: practice saying <strong>yes</strong> &ndash; not just verbally, but in your mindset.</p>
  <p class="p1">"Support someone else&rsquo;s idea, find the positive in what they say, and build on it," she said. "It&rsquo;s a small shift, but it changes the way you engage with people."</p>
  <p class="p1">She also encourages people to <strong>notice and acknowledge others more</strong> &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s a kind word to a store clerk or recognising the efforts of a colleague. These small moments of presence and appreciation help build better communication and stronger connections.</p>
  <p class="p2"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
  <p class="p1">Improvisation requires preparation, but it also means trusting yourself, adapting to the moment and focusing on others. Whether on stage or in daily life, these skills make us better speakers, better leaders and better humans.</p>
