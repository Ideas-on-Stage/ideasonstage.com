*Stylist Kay Korsh shares how speakers can use clothing to support their message, build credibility and connect with their audience. Learn how fit, colour and context influence how you're seen – on stage and on camera.*

When you speak on stage or on camera, your words matter – but your appearance influences how your audience receives your words. [In this episode of the *Ideas on Stage Podcast*](https://youtu.be/omLC61SLkVA), stylist **Kay Korsh** shares practical advice on how to dress in a way that supports your message and helps your audience connect with you faster.

Here are the key ideas from the conversation:

### **1. Fit is the foundation of credibility**

Poor fit – trousers that bunch at the ankle, sleeves that are too long or waistlines that sit incorrectly – can make you look sloppy, even if your content is strong. Audiences notice this, often subconsciously. Getting the fit right helps you look more professional and feel more confident.

### **2. Avoid unnecessary distractions**

From visible pocket linings to undone bows or buttons, small wardrobe issues can pull attention away from your message. Kay recommends testing your full outfit in front of a mirror or camera before any important talk or shoot.

### **3. Choose colours that work for you – and the venue**

Kay explains that colours should work with your skin tone *and* complement the setting. She suggests checking the stage or room background in advance so your outfit works with – not against – the environment.

### **4. Don’t dress like the audience – dress like yourself**

Speakers often try to match the audience, especially in corporate settings. But trying to blend in can weaken your presence. Kay encourages speakers to respect the context while still showing up as themselves. Done well, your style can reinforce your message.

### **5. Looking current builds connection**

You don’t need to follow fast trends, but looking up-to-date helps the audience relate to you. This includes clothing, but also details like hairstyle, facial hair, shoes and accessories. These elements form part of how people judge whether you’re credible and relevant.

### **6. Style is personal, not one-size-fits-all**

Whether you love fashion or – like me – want to think about it as little as possible, there’s a way to find a consistent look that reflects your expertise and personality. Kay recommends developing a simple “style formula” that fits who you are and how you want to be perceived.

### **7. One quick win: fix the length**

If you want to improve how you show up right away, Kay says to check the length of your garments – especially trousers and sleeves. A small tailoring adjustment can make a big difference in how put-together you appear.

Your appearance is part of your message. This episode offers clear, actionable steps to help you show up with more confidence, clarity and consistency – whether you’re on stage, on video or in a photo shoot.
