*Discover how humour can transform your business communication. In this episode of the Ideas on Stage Podcast, Beth Sherman – Emmy-winning comedy writer and speaker – shares practical strategies to connect with audiences, build trust and add just the right dose of humour to any message.*

In [this episode of the *Ideas on Stage Podcast*](https://youtu.be/7R5RLR_DJB4), Emmy Award-winning comedy writer **Beth Sherman** shares practical ways business leaders can use humour to build trust, connect with audiences and communicate more effectively.

With 30 years of experience in comedy and writing credits for shows like *The Late Show with David Letterman* and *The Tonight Show* with Jay Leno, Beth now helps professionals use humour to lead, inspire and persuade.

**Why Humour Works**

Humour creates emotional connection. It builds trust, makes people feel seen and encourages them to stay engaged. Beth explains that in business communication, if you can’t get your audience’s attention, all the effort you’ve put into crafting your message may fall flat.

She encourages us to think of humour as **humanity** or **relatability**. It doesn’t require clever jokes – just honest moments that people recognise and connect with.

**Three Tools for Using Humour Well**

Beth shared three ways to bring humour into your communication:

* **Self-awareness**: Know what your audience might be thinking, and respond to it. This could mean acknowledging something personal, visual or situational that might distract them. It's about showing that you’re present, grounded and aware of the moment you’re in.
* **Specificity**: Add clear, concrete details to make your stories more engaging and relatable. Beth gave the example of someone who quit their job to start a new business. Instead of stopping at "I quit and started over," add details: What did your boss say? What did your partner say? What did you do an hour later? The more specific you are, the more your story will resonate – and often, the humour is found in those small, real moments.
* **Surprise**: A small twist or unexpected response can spark connection. Beth shared a moment at a conference where someone asked her where she got her bottle of water. Her reply – "That’s not water, it’s gin" – made the other person laugh and broke the ice. The woman replied, "Even better." That created a moment of connection through the unexpected.

**When and How to Use It**

Beth compares humour to seasoning: you don’t need much, but the right amount can make a big difference. Use it:

* At the beginning, to build rapport
* In the middle, to hold attention
* At the end, to leave a lasting impression

If you use slides, Beth offers a simple reminder: **say it first, then show the slide.** This way, the slide reinforces your message instead of stealing its impact. And sometimes, you may not need a slide at all – don’t let visuals compete with your words.

**What If It Goes Wrong?**

Not every line will land. Beth says that’s normal – and often, if you’re sharing something real and human, it won’t go wrong. If the audience doesn’t respond, just keep going. If something feels off, acknowledge it with honesty. Most people will respect your sincerity.

**For Those Who Say, "I’m Not Funny"**

Beth hears this often. Her answer: you don’t need to be. If you’ve ever made a friend or family member laugh, you already know how to use humour. You don’t need jokes – just authenticity, truth and emotional connection.

**Final Tips**

* **Smile**: It’s a simple way to make people feel more at ease.
* **Watch comedians**: Learn how they use truth, timing and presence.
* **Capture real moments**: Keep a note on your phone to jot down observations of everyday life – especially moments that feel absurd or funny. If you can connect them to your subject, they often become your best material.

Beth's final message: "Humour is a love language. When used with care and truth, it helps people feel seen, heard and connected."
