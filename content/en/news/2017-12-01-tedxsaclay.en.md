For the third year running, Ideas on Stage was very happy to partner with the TEDx Saclay conference, which took place this November 30, 2017 in the brand-new [CentraleSupélec]( http://www.centralesupelec.fr/) amphitheater at the Plateau de Saclay on the powerful theme of “Serving the Living”.

## TEDx Saclay

Keeping standards typically high, this year’s event boasted a rich [program of speakers](https://tedxsaclay.com/2017/intervenants) including a few notably prestigious guests such as [Cédric Villani]( http://cedricvillani.org/) -- renowned mathematician and member of the French National Assembly -- as well as artists, scientists, students, entrepreneurs and even a Guinness World Record gamer ([Kayane](http://kayane.fr/2012/01/23/kayanes-guinness-world-records-pictures/)). Presenters shared moving stories on subjects ranging from the wonders of astrophysics ([Miho Janvier](https://www-perso.ias.u-psud.fr/mihojanvier/)), innovations in the fight against cancer ([André Choulika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Choulika)), butterflies and biophysics ([Maëlle Vilbert](https://tedxsaclay.com/editions/au-service-du-vivant/intervenants/maelle-vilbert)), the transformative art of storytelling ([Sylvie Mombo](http://www.artsdurecit.com/SYLVIE-MOMBO)), and of course, the blockchain ([Anca Petre](http://www.ancapetre.com/)).

## About the partnership

Ideas on Stage, business presentation specialists and official [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program) partner, have worked hand in hand with the TEDx Saclay organizers since their launch in 2014. From ideation to the stage, we coach presenters to help them deliver a clear and powerful message, illustrated by slides designed or reviewed by us and reinforced with coaching on the art of public speaking. 

As TEDx partners, we tailor our services according to the needs of the organizers and event: from simple speaker coaching to the creation of visual supports, or complete aid of the creation and animation of your TEDx. Have questions? Get in touch or you can learn a lot more about our TEDx services [here](https://www.ideasonstage.com/tedx/).
