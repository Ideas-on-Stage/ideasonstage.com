In today’s busy world, strong communication skills are more important than ever. I recently spoke with **Julian Treasure,** an expert in sound and communication, who shared his insights on speaking and listening with purpose. Julian’s experience as a renowned speaker and sound expert offers practical lessons for anyone looking to communicate better.

**Meet Julian Treasure**

Julian is widely known for his powerful TED Talks, which have over **150 million views** — and one is the **sixth most-viewed of all time**! His focus is both on speaking well and on listening effectively. As he says, “You always speak into a listening.” In other words, great communication isn’t just about talking; it’s about understanding who’s listening, too.

**Listening with Humility**

Julian believes humility is essential for good listening. When we approach conversations with an open mind and a desire to learn, we connect better with others. And, just like speaking, listening is a skill we can all develop.

*“The moment you think you've cracked it … that's a dangerous moment.” – Julian Treasure*

**Essential Tools for Effective Speaking**

Julian shared his "vocal toolbox," a set of simple but powerful techniques for communicating well:

**1. Breath Control**

Your voice is powered by your breath. Practising deep breathing can strengthen your voice and improve control.

**2. Posture**

Good posture helps your vocal cords work efficiently. Imagine a string pulling you up from the top of your head for a balanced stance.

**3. Vocal Tone**

Your tone impacts how others receive your message. Experiment with different tones to find a natural, confident sound.

**4. Using Silence**

Pauses add impact and let your audience absorb what you’re saying. Silence is a powerful tool.

**5. Embracing Nerves**

Julian views nerves as a sign of energy and excitement. He suggests using the "BESS" method — Breathe, Expand awareness, Stance, Smile — to calm yourself before speaking.

**Recommended Books on Sound, Listening and Communication** 

Julian also shared a few book recommendations on sound and listening:

\* **The Mysticism of Sound and Music** by Hazrat Inayat Khan 

\* **The Great Animal Orchestra** by Bernie Krause 

\* **Nada Brahma: The World is Sound** by Joachim E. Berendt 

\* **In Pursuit of Silence** by George Prochnik 

\* **A Book of Silence** by Sarah Maitland 

\* **TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking** by Chris Anderson 

**The Power of Communication** 

Julian’s advice highlights the importance of both speaking and listening. Improving these skills can transform relationships, boost career success and lead to personal growth. Whether you’re presenting to a crowd or chatting with a friend, good communication can enrich your life.
