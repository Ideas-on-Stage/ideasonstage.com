Plan and run highly effective meetings, both online and in person.

Meetings take up far too much of our professional lives, and most of them fail to achieve their objectives—if they even have any. Our Effective Meetings training offers a simple and efficient method to plan, prepare, and run highly effective meetings, both online and in person, freeing up time for other activities.

## Detailed Program

We are all spending more and more time in meetings, both online and in person, many of which are tiring and ineffective. Our Effective Meetings training offers a completely new approach to turning every meeting into a true success.

This training is based on a five-step method to design and lead a successful meeting:

- Foundation: Understand the context, set clear objectives, and choose the right participants
- Ideation: Structured brainstorming to identify the right ingredients for your meeting in order to achieve its objectives
- Creation: Prepare a clear agenda that maximizes attention and interaction
- Illustration: Prepare effective visual materials (slides) and documents to support your meeting
- Connection: Speak in a way that captures and maintains attention, and lead your meeting professionally
