In the Ideation stage, you take the transformational objectives you established in the Foundation stage, and find things to say, show and do to achieve those objectives: the raw materials of your presentation.

The additional resources for this stage should help you to use the pSCORE method to brainstorm effectively and find the right ingredients, which you can later mix together into a presentation storyline in the Creation stage.
