## Welcome to the Revolution

Congratulations on joining the Business Presentation Revolution! Please check your email for a link to download the introduction, covering the 5 major revolutions that can help you to change the way you present, and outlining the 5-stage Presentation SCORE Method that you can follow. (If it didn’t arrive, please check your junk mail… sometimes even the most important messages arrive there.) You can also download the book introduction by clicking on the button below.

You should also receive another email, asking you to confirm that you’d like to receive presentation tips and advice, and news about the book launch, webinars, etc. We’d love you to stay in touch so please click to confirm this. Of course you can unsubscribe at any time, so it’s up to us to give you useful content (without overloading your inbox) so you see the benefits. And naturally, we will not share your contact details with anyone outside Ideas on Stage.

Now, as a Business Presentation Revolutionary, we hope we can count on you to convince others to join the revolution. Wouldn’t the world be a better place if every presentation were effective, interesting and enjoyable?

So please tell your colleagues, tell your pets, tell the world! Simply click on the links below to share this page so your networks can also join the revolution and help fix presentations for good!
