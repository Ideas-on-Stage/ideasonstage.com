# Women on Stage
Public speaking training for female executives

Ideas on Stage partners with Marion Chapsal, specialist in public speaking and leadership for women, to offer Women on Stage, a unique training program designed for high-potential female executives.

This program addresses three key areas:

- The perception gap: the difference between how women perceive themselves and their actual performance as speakers.
- The visibility gap: the low percentage of women speaking on panels, conferences, and in the media as experts.
- The “double bind” gap: the phenomenon women face when speaking publicly—similar to the “double-bind” experienced by women in positions of power.

By the end of the training, participants will be able to:

- Identify impostor syndrome, its origins, and its effects
- Overcome fear of failure
- Express their legitimacy
- Recognize sexist attitudes or remarks
- Respond assertively to such attitudes
- Claim their space physically and mentally

This training is held in women-only groups, offering a safe space where participants can express themselves freely without judgment. A climate of trust is fostered to encourage genuine self-expression and growth.
