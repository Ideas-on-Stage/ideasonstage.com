What should you say—and what should you avoid saying—on camera? How can you ensure that your words are reported accurately? An interview is a very specific exercise in which every word counts. The potential impact on you and your organization—positive or negative—can be enormous.

Our Media Training program prepares senior executives for interviews on television, radio, and at conferences. Define your key messages and talking points. Strengthen your on-camera presence and speak with confidence.

During this training, you will discover how to use the “topspin” technique to always leave a positive impression. You will also learn how to handle the most challenging questions.
