Rose grew up in Los Angeles, California, where she became a natural Hollywood/Silicon Valley hybrid. After lead TV roles with Disney and FX, and with a degree in Cultural Anthropology from the University of California, Rose became a professional speaker on the topic of intercultural communication.

In 2014, she moved to San Francisco to join e-commerce startup Teespring as head of Culture, managing interior design, wellness, internal communication and an events calendar.

A move to Paris, France, brought her naturally to Ideas on Stage. Since 2017, Rose has helped clients from luxury to aerospace to bring transformative events to life while coaching leaders to present with confidence, authenticity and joy. Now based again in California, Rose works with clients around the world, while building our US operations. In her spare time, she dances, hikes and hosts the [Path & Purpose podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/path-purpose/id1522960084), dedicated to making meaning in the modern world through community, technology and ancient wisdom.
