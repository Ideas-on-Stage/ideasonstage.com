## Show the world the best version of yourself 


You come from make-up into a warm studio under hot lights, you take a seat opposite a journalist you hardly know, and after a brief greeting you are thrust via technology in front of a million pairs of eyes. Just as that thought hits your mind you’re being fired your first question, by someone who might not pull their punches. It suddenly feels even hotter under the lights.

Talking on video or in front of a live audience is stressful even for seasoned speakers, and when every word, every pause and every movement are observed and analysed, the potential impact on you and your business - positive or negative - can be huge. Facing an audience or a journalist without professional preparation would be a massive risk, but a well-prepared speaker has an important opportunity to shine.
