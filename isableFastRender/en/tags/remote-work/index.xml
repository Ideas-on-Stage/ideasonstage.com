      <description>With the current health crisis looming, remote work may no longer be a choice, but a precautionary measure. How do we do it at Ideas on Stage?
From day one, Ideas on Stage was created as a digital company. In fact, for many years, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a physical office. Even today, we strongly encourage our employees to work remotely and limit their travel to what&amp;rsquo;s necessary. We can deliver 90% of our services at distance to our clients, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the creation of a presentation, coaching or training.</description>
