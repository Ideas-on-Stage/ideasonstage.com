"e" is short for elements

The "e" elements folder contains very short snippets of common HTML/Hugo code that can be reused in multiple pages to help reduce the maintenance costs.

"e" elements should be very stable.

Try to limit these snippets to a single html <tag></tag> element, for example:
- <img>
- <a>...</a>
- <p>...</p>
- <div>...</div>

These "e" elements generate HTML, whereas "f" functions return a value and don't generate HTML in the document.
