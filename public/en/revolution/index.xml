      <description>Transcript Rose: OK. Yes. Got it. Thanks. Bye.
Rose: Welcome to the Business Presentation Revolution. I&amp;rsquo;m super stressed today because I have a presentation at the end of the day that I&amp;rsquo;m not prepared for. So I&amp;rsquo;ve called my coach to help turn this stress into success.
Michael: Hey Rose, what&amp;rsquo;s up?
Rose: Michael, I have a presentation at the end of the day. I helped prepare it with my colleagues so I know the slides but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do.</description>

      <description>Transcript Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution! I&amp;rsquo;m here with my colleague Michael Rickwood who&amp;rsquo;s going to be sharing with us what to do with our bodies while presenting.
So Michael, our clients regularly ask us: “What do I do with my body, my hands, my face while presenting?” What do you tell your clients?
Rose, what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about is gestures and we all need to use them on stage, but to be better at gestures it&amp;rsquo;s good to know about the four different types of gestures that we can use to be more effective communicators on stage.</description>
