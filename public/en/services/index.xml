      <description>This service will help you create an attractive remote-based work environment for your employees. We will create an online work community whose benefits will have long-lasting positive effects on the productivity and morale of your workforce.
Propelled into a remote work environment, managers and employees will instinctively try to replicate their traditional work environment. But they soon realize the differences: no face-to-face meetings, no informal talk at the coffee machine, impossibility to check what every employee does every single minute.</description>
