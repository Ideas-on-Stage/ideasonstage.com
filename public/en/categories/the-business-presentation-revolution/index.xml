      <description>Introducing The Business Presentation Revolution Podcast: your regular dose of Presentation Inspiration. In these bite-sized videos we share valuable tips on all aspects of the art of presenting, such as successful preparation practices, speaking tips to really engage a specific audience, slide design and more.
Rose Bloomfield is the anchor of the show, and Phil Waknell is the first guest to appear in the series. We’ll be sharing a new video every two weeks, so follow us on LinkedIn or subscribe on iTunes to get each episode hot off the press.</description>
