      <description>&amp;ldquo;Good enough&amp;rdquo; is not good enough. We help turn conferences into dynamic, memorable events, working with organizers and senior management to develop agendas and prepare speakers that make a lasting impact.
We begin by helping define transformational objectives, a unifying theme and a presentation and speaker development plan. We then design individual presentations and workshops to meet those objectives, and ensure success through the detailed planning of conference activities all the way to the final applause.</description>

      <description>A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator. They are entertainers, storytellers, showrunners, but it&amp;rsquo;s only the surface. They will immerse themselves in your event&amp;rsquo;s specific culture and add another dimension with their thought-provoking questions.
We have acted as Master of Ceremonies for numerous events for well-known companies such as Airbus, Microsoft, EDF and Pierre Fabre, as well as industry congresses and charity events, including COP21 and the World Social Forum.</description>
