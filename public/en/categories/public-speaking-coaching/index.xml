      <description>International TEDx expertise Producing a successful TEDx takes a lot of hard work in many different areas, but if everything is well-organised, what determines the success of the event is how well your speakers perform. It’s rarely the best-known speakers who deliver the stand-out talks: it’s the best-prepared speakers.
This is where Ideas on Stage comes in. Since we assisted photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand with his memorable TED talk in 2009, we have helped over 300 TEDx speakers to create, prepare and deliver the talks of their lives.</description>

      <description>Events &amp;amp; Conferences We help turn conferences into dynamic, memorable events, working with organizers and senior management to develop agendas and prepare speakers that make a lasting impact.
We begin by helping define transformational objectives, a unifying theme and a presentation and speaker development plan. We then design individual presentations and workshops to meet those objectives, and ensure success through the detailed planning of conference activities all the way to the final applause.</description>

      <description>Show the world the best version of yourself You come from make-up into a warm studio under hot lights, you take a seat opposite a journalist you hardly know, and after a brief greeting you are thrust via technology in front of a million pairs of eyes. Just as that thought hits your mind you’re being fired your first question, by someone who might not pull their punches. It suddenly feels even hotter under the lights.</description>
