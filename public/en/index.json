It’s rarely the best-known speakers who deliver the stand-out talks: it’s the best-prepared speakers.\nThis is where Ideas on Stage comes in. Since we assisted photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand with his memorable TED talk in 2009, we have helped over 300 TEDx speakers to create, prepare and deliver the talks of their lives. Curators across the world – from Montreal to Paris, from London to Washington DC – have trusted our professional storytelling experts, speaker coaches and designers to get the best out of their speakers.\nWhile most of our work is with major international corporations, helping senior executives with their most important presentations, our approach is to apply lessons from TED to the business world, rather than to apply business speaking basics to TED. So we’re not just your usual humdrum speaker coaches: we live and breathe TED every day, whether we’re working on a luxury product launch, a startup pitch or a TEDx talk.\nAnd since we love working with TEDx speakers and helping them spread their ideas, we do it for free - and in return we ask only to be listed with your other TEDx sponsors/partners. Of course our TEDx offers are subject to availability – it wouldn’t help you or anyone else if we tried to work on ten TEDx-es at once – but we usually find a way to help out if you give us enough advance notice.\nHere are the three levels of what we offer, starting with our free offer, and working all the way up to the full package which isn’t free, but offers a far greater contribution to your event.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b092db44cd25bd5fe9cc92d77584dce6","tags":null,"title":"TEDx Coaching","type":"tedx","url":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" How to create a great TEDx event, with Fabien Boutard, curator of TEDx Tours This summer we coached the speakers for TEDx Tours 2019, which took place on June 25 in the historical region of Touraine in France. The event space was none other than the Grand Théâtre de Tours, a beautiful piece of architecture à l’italienne. This region is also home to world-famous sites such as the Clos Lucé, where Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years in France, the charming castles of Amboise, Blois, Chenonceau, Chambord and many more.\nTEDx Tours is so successful it sells out every year. So to learn more about how to make such a successful event, Pierre Morsa sat down with their curator, Fabien Boutard, to discuss the challenges of organizing a TEDx and how to find great speakers. Whether you want to create a TEDx or TED-inspired business event, we hope this sparks some new ideas for you!\nPierre: Fabien, it\u0026rsquo;s the fifth year in a row that you are the TEDx Tours curator. What drives you to organize these events?\nFabien: The story began five years ago in Tours on my couch on a summer night. I was watching a TEDx video and I said to myself: “It’s incredible that in a city with so many medical researchers, universities and so much intellectual potential, there is no way to communicate the results to the general public in a clear and simple way.” I then realized that the TEDx format was in fact perfect to showcase the bright ideas of our region and its inhabitants. It was also a way for me to satisfy my curiosity and find more inspiration.\nPierre: We know that it can be stressful. What advice would you give to other organizers to make things easier?\nFabien: TEDx events are organized by non-profit organizations, by teams entirely made of volunteers. The quality of the team is what really makes the difference. You’re often going to work for one year without knowing what the end result will be. To stay on track, each member has to know why he’s taking part in this adventure, what is his role and why it’s important. Then everything happens in the course of four hours. Months of work get rewarded, and it’s truly a magical moment! The other critical element is the quality of the speakers.\nPierre: Over the past years, you\u0026rsquo;ve found some great speakers that nobody knew. What is your secret?\nFabien: What we do is probably different from other events. We first list the ideas we would like to see on stage, then we find the best speakers we can find for each topic. We try to foresee what will be interesting in 1 year from now, not what is interesting today. With social networks, everything goes in and out of fashion incredibly quickly nowadays. Something that was on everyone’s mind may have become old news three months later; it already happened to us.\nPierre: How important is the preparation?\nFabien: No matter how famous your speaker is, the preparation phase is crucial. You should never compromise on the quality of the preparation. The best speakers spend between 30 and 50 hours writing, illustrating and practicing their talk. That may sound like a lot, but it is what it takes. The first step is to make sure the talk is going to be structured around a clear, key idea. Then there is a fairly long writing phase. Some prefer to write everything, others prefer to write the storyline only. It’s a fine balance between respecting what the speaker wants to say and making sure it’s going to be clear and impactful for the public. The last step is to practice, practice, practice until perfect.\nPierre: What advice would you give to people who want to be invited to give a TEDx talk?\nFabien: Why would your topic be of interest for the TEDx audience? We never select a personality or an ability to speak in public first: we always give more importance to the message that you want to communicate. It’s not necessary to send us a CV; having a message worth spreading is what counts.\nPierre: What do you think is the most important thing on D-Day?\nFabien: What we realized since the first edition, what worked, and sometimes didn’t, is when the audience experiences something greater than the sum of the talks. It then becomes a unique adventure, for the audience, for the speakers and for us. It’s our responsibility to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable and enjoyable evening, that the subtle alchemy between the various elements creates something unique and unforgettable.\nThank you very much, Fabien, for your inspiring tips to organize a great TEDx event!\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"45e552c9da0f6123bc50e0d81789a242","tags":null,"title":"TEDx Tours 2019","type":"services","url":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/events/tedx-tours-2019/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Train your teams to give TED-quality business presentations Presentations are everywhere in business, and most of them fail to reach their objectives - if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.\nThe Business Presentation Revolution, accompanied by the book of the same name, is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method. This course is taught in leading companies and forms part of the HEC Paris Executive MBA curriculum.\nThe course follows the four key steps of the Presentation SCORE method:\n Preparation - understanding your audience and their needs, setting your objective, and brainstorming to find your key messages Storytelling - shaping your messages into a compelling storyline that grabs and keeps the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and makes your key messages stick Visual Design - illustrating your talk with powerful visual aids that help your audience to understand and remember, instead of the typical death-by-bullet-point that only makes them switch off Speaking - preparing to speak, rehearsing, and delivering your presentation comfortably and convincingly.  The Business Presentation Revolution can be configured to meet your team\u0026rsquo;s needs, from a half-day introduction all the way up to the full three-day course where every participant prepares and delivers their own presentation and receives individual advice on how to improve even further. The longer the course, the more hands-on it will be.\nMany companies choose to combine The Business Presentation Revolution with some Public Speaking Coaching, giving each participant a few hours of one-on-one coaching after the course to help them apply and perfect the new methods.\nTo find out more about The Business Presentation Revolution and how it can help your teams to present more effectively, please fill in our contact form below.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"c81b0c9eb3c213e086f450b158b2080c","tags":null,"title":"The Business Presentation Revolution Training","type":"services","url":"/presentations-training/the-business-presentation-revolution/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator.

Your document or presentation was received, but will it be read? Will it be remembered? And most importantly, will it be acted upon? Or, did you just waste your time \u0026hellip;\nEach year companies create millions of presentations and documents. Yet most of them are boring, hard to understand and lack a clear purpose. The information is there, but it doesn’t stick; and so, it is quickly forgotten.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Presentations and documents can be engaging, clear, and to the point. They are not doomed to slowly collect dust in the bottom of the receiver’s inbox. And because your competitors’ presentations are likely to be unappealing, it’s easy to get noticed! How? By combining reason and emotion.\nMaking the receiver hear your message is not enough. You have to catch their interest to make them want to listen. To achieve this, we will first arouse their natural curiosity. Once hooked, we’ll tell a story that speaks to them and their needs, reassures them and makes them want to buy, or act on your message.\nWe rely on a stable team of writers with years of experience delivering storytelling and copywriting for some of the best companies in the world. We can make the most technical subject interesting. In fact, we’ve done just that for a wide range of industries, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetics, finance, and heavy industries.\nTo deliver great stories consistently we use tools exclusive to Ideas on Stage, such as the Audience Transformation Roadmap. This helps us understand your goal, who your audience is and what they need to be persuaded to do. We also use an extensive range of storytelling techniques to keep your audience engaged.\nIdeas on Stage removes the pain from the writing process.

Women, when they are speaking at the workplace, almost never get it “Just Right”. Some have advised women to be more assertive and to take on masculine attitudes. Others have suggested they should stick with their roles and act their more feminine attributes. In both cases, it doesn’t work. To quote the famous leading organization Catalyst for women and business, “women are damned if they do, doomed if they don’t”. This double-bind that women face every day has created a search for a way-out, a solution.\nWomen are still culturally trained to look for perfection, to seek for approval and acceptance, to ask permission to express themselves, to avoid failure at all costs, and to feel shame to go out and show how ambitious they can be. We are still very dependant on \u0026ldquo;what will people think of me ?\u0026rdquo; and we would do anything to avoid shame, criticism and judgement.\nIn Women on Stage we’ll explore a way to be heard, taken seriously, and given the authority to make change we so clearly see, without giving up on our femininity, and allowing us to express all the nuances of our emotions, personality and intelligence.\nDiscover the power of PRESENCE and develop your unique presence on stage. Here and NOW. Neither feminine, nor masculine, but integrating your whole self, mind, body and heart.\nThis workshop is for you if…  You are a woman leader in any industry, a woman entrepreneur or a senior executive woman taking on roles with increased visibility You are required to make impactful presentations, but you do not feel entirely confident, no matter what others tell you and how experienced you can appear to be You are a high-achiever but you struggle with perfectionism and you are familiar with the imposter syndrome You sometimes feel that when you start to speak, you are interrupted or shot down before finishing your pitch You feel you need to be cautious about expressing your ideas, walking a tightrope You stay quiet during meetings for fear of being judged too aggressive or because your voice sounds too soft You would like to be perceived differently than related to your gender, but feel caught up in the double-bind You believe that improving your presentation skills will advance your leadership influence but you want to do this in a safe, supportive and entertaining environment  Key takeaways  Understand the double-bind effect for women when they communicate at work and get away from this polarity Discover the ten most common traps women fall into when they speak in public Explore what to do instead and discover the power of presence in delivery, via breathing, voice and posture techniques Learn how to deal with stage fright and embrace your fears Get the recognition you deserve with increased visibility and impact Get support and nourishment within a circle of women committed to their personal and professional growth Learn how to pick up your own style of communication, “made to mesure” that fits YOU and only you Bring your best self centre-stage  Learning Methods This is not going to be your traditional corporate training, so be prepared to work and play on the edge. We will talk and reflect, but also play, improvise, draw, relax and create. Bonus: you will be introduced to Marion’s innovative and fun 3 D coaching method, playing with archetypes.\nOne week prior to the workshop you will receive a questionnaire about your specific speaking challenges and your expectations for this workshop. You will also be asked to prepare a specific assignment, according to your profile and challenges.\nFacilitator Marion Chapsal, Ideas on Stage Chief Learning Officer\nMarion’s relentless quest is to coach women to find their voice, communicate with confidence and enthusiasm, and develop fully as 21st century women leaders. She has created Women on Stage because she believes that, still today, women’s voices are not fully heard, much less appreciated and acted upon and need more than ever to be taken into account and to have an impact to make the world a better place for all men and women.\nIn her unique coaching approach, Marion taps into theater techniques and gently encourages role playing, creating a safe and respectful environment where each participant feels free to express feelings, ideas, intuitions, take risks and pretend to be the change they want to see.\nMarion brings with her more than twenty years of executive training and coaching in Leadership and communication. She has taught Leadership at EM Lyon Business School and Cranfield School of Management. She’s a certified Master NLP coach, a rebirther and trained in Drama School and theater techniques. At 50, she went back to University to study a Master in Gender Studies, Sociology \u0026amp; linguistics, focusing on gender, speaking and power. It could have ended in a PhD; instead, she created Women on Stage.\n…and she also brings her huge collection of Comic Strips, animated movies and fairy tales characters, representing a very wide range of role-models and archetypes. The use of figurines is fantastic because it’s so easy, simple and fun!\nMarion is here to help women overcome their reluctance to shine in their lives and work, and recognize how incredibly brave and powerful they already are.\nTo organize a Women on Stage workshop for your company, or if you\u0026rsquo;d like to attend one of our public workshops, please contact us using the form below.

It works well and has been widely adopted by corporations and individuals seeking to provide a quality service to employees working remotely or on different sites.\nThe security problem itself was easy to correct, and, at the time of this article, should have been fixed. But there is something else Zoom needs to fix: its crisis communication approach. One thing in particular made users and the security community extremely unhappy: the “others do it too” attitude. It’s exactly when you reprimand your child because he did something wrong, and he answers, “but other kids did it too!” As a parent, it’s only going to make you even more annoyed. Why? Because that shows he doesn’t get the point, and that instead of learning from his mistake, he’s trying to get approval for his incorrect behavior. And this is basically what Zoom’s initial answer was: “We don’t need to fix this problem, and it’s not really a problem because others do it too.”\nThis is what we call the “others too” communication mistake. Using others’ bad behavior to justify yours. Pointing others’ mistakes is fine if you clearly show that you’re going to correct yours. Zoom’s impact would have been completely different if they had said, “We’re going to fix this problem immediately, others have that problem too.” By taking responsibility to correct their mistake first, the rest of the communication takes a whole different meaning. Small difference in wording, huge difference in result.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"ec75bb19beb00179033dfc0b7ad836a6","tags":["Public Relations","Communication","Crisis Management"],"title":"“Others Too”: Zoom's Terrible Communication Misstep","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/07/16/2019-07-16-others-too-zoom-s-terrible-communication-misstep/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Fear"],"content":"One of the most stressful moments when speaking at an event is actually not during your presentation, but the hours before your presentation. To some speakers, the wait can be so stressful that they completely lose their presence. As mother nature didn\u0026rsquo;t give humans an appropriate instinctive response to face the stress of a presentation, they adopt one of the basic survival techniques for protection: they fight the public, they flee, or they \u0026ldquo;play dead\u0026rdquo;. The longer they wait, the worse the problem becomes.\nMy advice is simple: put these speakers early in the program. You may want to put a seasoned speaker on stage first, but then I recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t let the nervous ones wait for too long. This will greatly reduce the risk of meltdown on stage.\nOf course, there are techniques to cope with stress. There are easy tricks, but when the source of the stress is a lack of self-confidence or self-esteem, that takes time to correct. In some cases, it can be a lifelong battle. If you feel some speakers are not going to manage the stress well, don\u0026rsquo;t make them wait for too long, it will make them feel miserable and they will not enjoy the experience.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b1d3ba6af6c0efef5875526ed79b7425","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Fear"],"title":"Put your most nervous speakers early in the program","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/07/09/2019-07-09-put-your-most-nervous-speakers-early-in-the-program/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"content":"You know these presenters who speak for 20 minutes before they finally understand what they are talking about? I had a colleague who was just like that. When I asked him why he couldn’t do a shorter introduction, he said that he felt that all the details he gave in his opening were indispensable to understand the presentation. In other words, he was taking the time to explain the context before talking about his subject. That sounded good in theory. The problem was, because nobody knew what the exact subject was, the elements of context had no meaning and were extremely boring. Making matters worse, because my colleague had not started by identifying the subject, he rambled for much longer than what was really necessary.\nHowever, correcting that problem is fairly easy.\nStart by presenting the “why you are talking today,” the key topics, before anything else. If these topics cannot be understood without context, then they are not clear enough, and should be reformulated.\nOnly once you have done that can you present the context. Avoid the “all you can eat” approach, only give the minimum necessary to understand the key topics.\nThis simple method will make your presentations much more interesting from the beginning, and much easier to follow for your audience.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"76cbd7a77e6a449c827ddd98515a2ff6","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"Start with the subject, not the context","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/07/02/2019-07-02-why-you-should-avoid-long-winded-introductions-in-your-presentations/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Oratory","Body Language"],"content":"Should we move on stage when speaking, to avoid looking static? Or should we stay put on our feet, avoiding any unnecessary movements? Strangely, if we ask different coaches, we\u0026rsquo;re likely to get different answers. I remember meeting several coaches who followed classical theatre training at \u0026ldquo;La Comédie Française\u0026rdquo;, and they would recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t move on stage when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking. I also remember other coaches telling startup pitchers that they looked like dead trees devoid of any energy because they didn\u0026rsquo;t move enough. So who is right?\nAs often, the correct answer is: it depends. It always pains me to see some coaches give \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; advice without taking into account the subtleties of public speaking. A few examples of factors that may influence how much you move:\n The formality of the setting Your natural style as a speaker The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be filmed  If we are in a very formal setting, typically a political meeting, it\u0026rsquo;s best no to move too much. If the setting is more informal, like a pitch contest, looking dynamic and energetic is essential, we can move on stage. We could even jump and everybody would be fine with it (although we recommend not to do it Ballmer style).\n   We saw some speakers deliver killer speeches sitting down or from behind a lectern, not moving at all. At the opposite end, we saw speakers pace energetically on stage and make a great impression. The key is that their posture was coherent with their style, and that when they moved, it was on purpose, not because they could not control their nerves. A good coach will help you understand and build a style that fits your personality, not force you into a predefined stereotypical imaginary \u0026ldquo;ideal presenter\u0026rdquo; (a notion I will develop further in another article).\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re being filmed, avoid moving around too much. It will make good camera work harder. Often the lighting is set to be optimal in a specific location of the stage. Try to stay there.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"6d700815665b94af8caa24f0ddb5fec7","tags":["Public Speaking","Oratory","Body Language"],"title":"Should I move on stage when speaking?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/06/25/2019-06-25-should-i-move-on-stage-when-speaking/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Body language"],"content":"The communication industry is full of myths that are repeated without any scientific backing.

When we created the company, we rented a space in a shared office. But the business center was nearly always full and we had to book the rooms weeks in advance, which was extremely inconvenient. As a young company, we didn’t want to spend too much, so when the first promotion of startups graduated from the Parisian accelerator “Le Camping,” we moved with them in a place called “L’After,” a name that was more reminiscent of a place where spent partygoers would try to recover than a place where you conducted serious business. It was also a bit decrepit, and we had to fight for space between the ping-pong table and the Geeks.\nThis is history.

Yes. Got it. Thanks. Bye.\nRose: Welcome to the Business Presentation Revolution. I\u0026rsquo;m super stressed today because I have a presentation at the end of the day that I\u0026rsquo;m not prepared for. So I\u0026rsquo;ve called my coach to help turn this stress into success.\nMichael: Hey Rose, what\u0026rsquo;s up?\nRose: Michael, I have a presentation at the end of the day. I helped prepare it with my colleagues so I know the slides but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. Do you have any advice for me?\nMichael: Rose. What you need are the three S’s of Success.\nRose: What are those?\nMichael: First things first. Serenity. You\u0026rsquo;re going to stop working. You\u0026rsquo;ve been working very, very hard. Trust the fact that you know it, you know your slides. They\u0026rsquo;re finished. Put down the computer.\nRose: Put down\u0026hellip; put down the computer.\nMichael: Yep. I\u0026rsquo;m telling you to do that.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: Also to be serene, you cannot present effectively drinking coffee. This is really, really bad: coffee, energy drinks\u0026hellip; Put that aside.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: And put your phone on silent.\nRose: You\u0026rsquo;re going a little far, Michael.\nMichael: Put it on silent. Give your brain space to relax. And also, for serenity it’s important with regards to this venue, right?\nRose: Yeah.\nMichael: Get there early.\nRose: Ok. That\u0026rsquo;s okay. I can do that. I can get there early.\nMichael: Now the second S of Success is about Space. When you arrive at that venue tonight, early, make sure you give yourself time to go on stage. Stand up there. If you can, pass your slides, test your videos and have a go at rehearsing on stage. If you can\u0026rsquo;t with a technical team then rehearse by yourself looking at the room in front of you and discovering it.\nRose: That makes sense. OK. I\u0026rsquo;m going to get there early. I can test the stage. I can look at the space.\nMichael: Absolutely, and also know where you\u0026rsquo;re entering from, where you\u0026rsquo;re exiting and where you\u0026rsquo;re going to be placed before you show up on stage, and also know where the water is. In case you get dry mouth or something like that.\nRose: OK. That actually really helps, just to start imagining the space. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it quickly but I think I will go back and I\u0026rsquo;ll check the stage and do exactly like you said: entrances, exits\u0026hellip;\nMichael: Exactly.\nRose: …where am I sitting before I present. I feel pretty good with those two first S\u0026rsquo;s: Serenity, Space. What\u0026rsquo;s the third S?\nMichael: So the third S is basically to seek Support. So, when you get there, seek out who are the technical people lighting you, miking you up, and looking after the slides and the guy who has the clicker. Because these people are great to introduce yourself to, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking after you and you\u0026rsquo;re going to feel so much better about doing that.\nRose: Michael, this is making so much sense. It has really helped me calm down and I know our viewers can relate to that moment. So, would you recap these three excellent S\u0026rsquo;s for us?\nMichael: Absolutely. First one: Serenity - find your focus and find your calm. Two: Space - get into the space where you\u0026rsquo;re gonna be presenting. Three: Seek out technical Support. Get to know the guys who are looking after you and making you great on stage.\n Serenity: find your focus and your calm. Space: get into the space where you’re going to present. Support: seek out technical help.  Rose: So if you enjoyed what you heard here today, please join the revolution by subscribing to our YouTube channel, iTunes and following us on LinkedIn. We hope to see you next time. Please leave your comments, like, share with your colleagues. And may you stay serene for your next presentation. Thanks again Michael.

After all, many of the techniques that are taught today were developed by some guys in togas before year one of our calendar!\nBut the world has changed a lot since then, and recent technology advances have opened new exciting possibilities for public presentation training. One of these technologies is virtual reality. If you’re in the Paris area, we now have the possibility to supplement our traditional public speaking coaching with virtual reality in combination with our traditional oratory coaching.\nThere are many advantages to using virtual reality. The most obvious one is the ability to simulate a large audience. We always try to make speakers practice in a setting which is as close to the real situation as possible, but assembling 500 people in a room to play the public is simply not feasible. Virtual Reality changes that. It allows the speaker to face a virtual public and learn how to interact with it. The simulation of the emotions of the public will let the orator learn how to stay cool and manage any situation, and how to handle tough questions with confidence.\nThe public speaking virtual reality training simulation can be used in different situations, for example\n Presentation training for your sales team Negotiation training for managers Public speaking training for an internal event  In the comfort and discretion of our offices on the Champs Élysées, in the heart of Paris, you will get the most complete public speaking coaching possible. Whether it’s to train for small group negotiations or to deliver a keynote speech in front of your employees or the press, virtual reality will ensure that you are fully prepared.

But its over-reliance on movement effects quickly became a visual nuisance, making the audience feel as if they had been on a boat caught in a category 10 hurricane. During the first three years after its launch we got requests for Prezi presentations regularly, but it’s not the case anymore. So what went wrong with Prezi? The core problem of Prezi is simple: it does not address the real problem of PowerPoint. Audiences are not bored because of PowerPoint, but because of how PowerPoint is misused by presenters, and adding more zooming in and out ad nauseam is not going to solve anything. The true remedy to bad PowerPoint presentations lies somewhere else:\n Teaching speakers how to build a compelling narrative for their presentations before opening PowerPoint. Designing slides that effectively reinforce or clarify the speaker’s story.  Don’t be mistaken.

I haven’t seen it, and I didn’t want to see it before writing this article. Whether it accurately follows the storyline of the books or not is a moot point, because said book hasn’t been written yet. And it shows. I won’t spoil anything, don’t worry. But everyone noticed that the screenwriting of the seasons that could rely on George R. R. Martin’s material was much better than the seasons that had to rely on external writers. And I will use that as an example of how important a great storyline is for a great presentation.\nLet’s first look at the material that the showrunners used for the first seasons of Game of Thrones, the books collectively known as “A Song of Ice and Fire,” written by George R. R. Martin (aka GRRM). I’m not a fan of GRRM’s writing style. I find the general style of the sentences a bit “plain.” However, GRRM is exceptional at two things:\n The storyline. The perfect plot and its twists were what made Game of Thrones what it is. By refusing to follow common writing wisdom in favor of a more complex, realistic and gritty storyline, GRRM created numerous shocks and surprises, but none of them were gratuitous. They were all at the service of the storyline. Short killer lines that could accomplish in a few words what could not have been done in several pages of writing. Take Tyrion, for example. The fact that he is one of the most beloved characters in the series is entirely due to the great lines GRRM put in his mouth.  If you compare it to the seasons filmed without GRRM’s books, it’s plain that:\n The storyline is much more conventional. There are a lot more deus ex machina moments. Some plot twists feel forced and illogical. It’s clear the writers wanted to capture the spirit of GRRM’s writing, but didn’t manage to put their plot twists at the service of the storyline. The short killer lines are gone. Not much more to say. This is why Tyrion feels so useless during these last seasons.  What does it mean for your presentations? It means that the storyline always comes first. Everything you say and show has to be directly relevant to the storyline. The storyline will dictate how easy (or how hard) your presentation is to follow. The storyline will dictate how surprising, how impactful your presentation will be.\nThe storyline is not everything, as the short killer lines demonstrate. A presentation is much more: the quality of the delivery, the quality of the visuals, etc. But the storyline is its backbone, and cannot be rushed.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"920be2750d6fcef26c4b9d65a914d92b","tags":["Public Speaking","Storyline","Storytelling","Presentation"],"title":"Game of Thrones and the importance of the storyline","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/05/21/2019-05-21-game-of-thrones-and-the-importance-of-the-storyline/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Transcript Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution! I\u0026rsquo;m here with my colleague Michael Rickwood who\u0026rsquo;s going to be sharing with us what to do with our bodies while presenting.\nSo Michael, our clients regularly ask us: “What do I do with my body, my hands, my face while presenting?” What do you tell your clients?\nRose, what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about is gestures and we all need to use them on stage, but to be better at gestures it\u0026rsquo;s good to know about the four different types of gestures that we can use to be more effective communicators on stage.\nThere are four types of gestures?\nOK, what\u0026rsquo;s the first one? The first ones are called illustrators. Now these are the gestures that you use while you\u0026rsquo;re speaking and these are great for three reasons. The first reason is that it helps people to absorb better what you’re saying. The next reason is because it helps you to channel stress. And the third reason is it helps you to remember your words as you\u0026rsquo;re speaking.\nOkay, so there are some that we\u0026rsquo;re using while we\u0026rsquo;re talking like the Italians do. What\u0026rsquo;s the second type of gesture?\nThe second type of gestures - on a cultural note - are called emblems. These are the gestures that you\u0026rsquo;re using when you don\u0026rsquo;t speak or don\u0026rsquo;t have any words, so gestures that really speak for themselves. So for example Rose you\u0026rsquo;re from the USA. In the USA you have specific nonverbal gestures like that which will work right, like thumbs up or hello goodbye.\nNot every gesture works in every country so that\u0026rsquo;s something to think about. That\u0026rsquo;s really important if you\u0026rsquo;re doing international business. One thing might mean something very positive in one country such as our OK sign in America, and that could mean something very different in another country. So with intercultural communication it\u0026rsquo;s important to have a little coaching on that beforehand.\nAll right, what\u0026rsquo;s our next gesture Michael?\nSo now I want to talk about the face and what we call affect displays. Now the face is very expressive and this is very useful for example with storytelling: we want to tell about a past experience. The face is very important. How can we make the most of it?\nOK, I love that and something that it makes me think of is congruence and how important it is that our facial expressions agree with what we\u0026rsquo;re doing with our body. So if you\u0026rsquo;re telling a positive message, having that effect of a positive expression - a smile etc - and if you\u0026rsquo;re delivering hard news, you might not want to be smiling with a teethy grin.\nRight, kind of like this. But facial expressions also vary from culture to culture. In Latin America and Europe you\u0026rsquo;re going to be much more expressive than for example in Asia.\nAnything else that we should know in terms of gesture types?\nWell there\u0026rsquo;s one more that I haven\u0026rsquo;t spoken about and these are regulators. These are the gestures that you use in order to tell the audience what to do. They\u0026rsquo;re called regulators so it\u0026rsquo;s simply a case of: sit down, stand up, OK everybody please move to the other room. So these gestures are really about interacting and giving orders to the audience and I suppose something a teacher might use quite a lot.\nOK right such as… bring it down.\nOK, perfect!\nMichael, now we know what to do with our body, is there anything we should avoid?\nYes, there are certain gestures that we do that reflect or tell the audience about our negative inner states. These are called parasitical gestures and you should try to avoid them. Things such as playing with your hair or your clothes, wringing your hands together or or anything that\u0026rsquo;s giving those negative feelings away. You can get rid of them by just either working with a coach or just filming yourself and watching it back over to see what you need to eliminate. Pacing unnecessarily is another thing.\nExcellent stuff, thank you Michael. Now we know what to do with our bodies, what to avoid, is there any last tip to share with our viewers?\nAbsolutely. When in doubt, relax. Audiences love that.\nI love it!\nSo, three things to remember:\nOne, there are different types of gestures to use. Experiment. Two, avoid parasitical gestures, doing things unconsciously. Three, when in doubt, relax.\nThank you so much for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Even well-known tech conferences fail to engage their audiences all the time. But medical conferences can be among the worst. Check out this quick interview between Ideas on Stage, new partners with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, and Denise Silber to find out how to take medical (and other) events to the next level.\nOur friend Ross Fisher, a paediatric surgeon based in the UK, has had enough of poor medical communication, and when he’s not operating, he spends time educating doctors about a better way to present. There is a clear need, and Ross is making progress.\nIdeas on Stage has worked with many health-based conferences and events over the years, from internal events for pharma companies to open industry events in nephrology, oncology and other therapeutic areas. It’s clear that our approach to better presentations works very well in this field, and we’ve helped to design several very successful events.\nNow we are adding an extra string to our bow thanks to our partnership with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, run by Denise Silber, an experienced bilingual (English/French) event planner and Master of Ceremonies, who is specialized in healthcare communication, and helps organizers to build next-generation events and conferences with patients at the center.\nWe asked Denise some questions about medical conferences, and how our new partnership can help bring them to the next level.\n1. What is wrong with most medical conferences?\nDENISE SILBER: To start with, few physicians say they’re attending their conferences because of the content. They\u0026rsquo;re going to see their colleagues, to take a break from their routine, to visit a new city.\nIt’s a bit like going to the theater for the intermission. And when they do get in the conference room, it’s often “same old, same old”, with slide-based presentations and panels on usual topics or poster sessions…\nThe scientific committee that produces the agenda is likely not following what’s happening in communication and audio-visual techniques. The programs are often not addressing the big shifts in medicine with new technologies and the rise of start-ups, the new role of professionals and patients, the new ethical challenges. And to top it all off, much of the content is available to participants without physically attending.\n2. But surely people expect to sit there and receive lots of top-down detail - how best to meet their expectations while producing a 2.0 kind of conference?\nDS: Yes, people want to receive lots of top-down detail, but, as you know at Ideas on Stage, scientific content can be presented in an engaging or even captivating way.\nMy suggestion is not to change everything at once, but for organizers to go beyond the typical post-conference satisfaction survey and sit down and talk with participants to understand what they did and didn’t like, and then to run with some of the suggestions, to experiment on the least successful parts of their event.\n3. How important is it to include the patient’s point of view in medical events?\nDS: Inviting patients in from the beginning of the planning can make a huge difference. When physicians become patients, they are often very surprised by the experience in their own hospital.\nThe patient reminds us of the real-world viewpoint and of the basic mission of medicine, to help people. They bring irreplaceable testimony to the table. And their presence, both in the sessions and at the breaks, makes for a feel-good, human moment.\n4. What does Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You bring to medical conferences?\nDS: Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You brings new life to medical conferences, thanks to our extensive experience in producing exciting digital health events.\nEach of our clients’ conferences will have special needs and requirements, so we don’t have a formulaic approach. Services include: program and speaker consulting where we bring in novel topics, new speakers, formatting recommendations; creating engagement through a “challenge” or other activity that begins before the event, original demos, and social media articles and deployment. We can guide the conference to a « Patient-Included » certification, which can be transformative. This involves inviting patients to the organizing table, as part of the agenda, and in the room.\n5. Why partner with Ideas on Stage to help transform medical events?\nDS: This partnership is quite easy to understand.

Ultimately, we were talking about inspiring a shift in culture. We gathered as much information as we could before wrapping up the meeting with quick sips of coffee to match Chavy’s speedster-pace.\nThis is how the project started — for us. But Chavy and his team had kicked-off planning the conference that summer, more than 8 months before the event would take place. Not everyone starts this well in advance. But let me assure you, it pays off.\nAt Ideas on Stage, we’ve had the pleasure of helping clients from practically all sectors bring creative and substantial presentations and events to life many times over. This was going to be a fun challenge given how out-of-the-box the client wanted to be in achieving the fundamental goals: inspire employee pride, reignite team unity and accelerate innovation to succeed in today’s world. Fueled up, we sent Chavy a proposal for our plan forward. He agreed and we put pedal to the metal.\nThe Challenge Normally, we need to consider some or all of the following elements in designing an event: budget, location, scheduling, possible discrepancies between organizers’ objectives and audience needs, overcoming bad presentation habits like death-by-PowerPoint, and harmonizing key messages across speakers and workshops.\nFor Mövenpick’s conference, our top risk was message-related. We needed to step out of ‘business as usual’, while not overstretching general managers’ sensibilities to create a snap-back. GMs impact everything from sales to front-office operations, so we needed to avoid the risk of destabilizing them and in turn, their team and guests. We needed to strike a warm tone with a clear ‘why’ supporting the call for a shift in culture. We needed to be glued to the question: what (in this culture shift) is in it for them?\nThe managers were coming from all around the world, an array of cultures and in many cases a relatively classic business paradigm. So, how would we effectively disrupt older assumptions and enroll them in an update across all touch-points in their hotels?\nThere were also scheduling and location constraints. Plus, conflicting conferences happening in the same time period, which GMs would need to attend. So how did we mitigate said risks and optimize opportunity in our planning?\nThe Solution Step one: align key stakeholders. To do this, we facilitated a full-day brainstorm in Geneva with their executive committee, or I should say, both of them. Chavy had recently engaged a shadow ExCom-Y team powered by millennials. During this synergistic gathering, Phil Waknell and I took the diverse group through Ideas on Stage methodology to synchronize objectives, distill key messages and capture creative ideas.\nThere were many questions to be asked, but first things first: we always start with our ABCs; of course I don’t mean the alphabet. We begin by gathering all there is to know regarding the specific Audience — the GMs in this case; their Burning Needs — what did they need out of this conference? And the Context — where and when exactly will the conference take place? Audience, Burning Needs, Context.\nSince that full day in Geneva it was clear we were working with a special group. Chavy and his team were not just talking about transformation, they were walking the change. To assure highest impact, they decided it was worth bringing in an external partner to keep things on target and provide fresh insight.\nThe day wrapped up with a succulent dinner in the heart of Geneva. (Mövenpick knows how to tie everything together with a beautiful moment.) This kind of generosity and attention to detail wove throughout the next 6 months until the final applause at the end of their conference.\nBetween that day and the event on April 25th, many steps were taken to ensure the success of this event. Here are the super six takeaways which you can put into practice now:\n Define a clear objective and tie it together with a theme. We decided early on about larger organizing elements, such as the theme of the conference, which would harmonize our main objective across a full 3-day line-up of presentations and workshops. We needed something that would inspire an internal culture change towards being faster, more connected, performance-oriented and having fun. A theme for rethinking the possible and changing gears with changing times. The theme: “SHIFT 2018” Add an inspirational gem. We gathered candidates for external speakers that would elevate our theme and draw insightful real-world connections. Who would represent best-in-class performance, efficiency, collaboration and all with a heart-pumping story of optimism and appetite for adventure? The speaker: ace solo sailor Alex Thomson, 2nd place Vendée Globe Champion Schedule and sync with presenters well in advance. To be sure all workshops and presentations were coherent, unique, memorable and impactful, we scheduled on average two hours of coaching with each contributor, of which there were a good 30 across the 2-day agenda. There were TED-inspired keynotes, panels, a live press briefing (one of the client’s many brilliant ideas), interactive workshops, and 10min lightning talks. The success of an event is determined before it begins. Given the packed agenda and the client’s commitment to success, we deployed the needed resources: two Speaker Coaches, a Master of Ceremonies, plus a Design Director all onsite for the entire event including rehearsals the day before. The takeaway: You can’t prepare too early, too well, or too much. Sprinkle on special touches. From the moment participants arrived the night before they were greeted with thoughtful gifts in their rooms, including products they were being asked to adopt in their hotels. There was also a surprise pair of Converse sports shoes, in the right size, which the normally shined-shoe crew were certainly not expecting. They were told that without their sneakers they couldn’t take a step into the conference. This was a true hit and left a memorable impression on everyone as a symbolic feature representing their unity as a team, accentuating the need for speed and fun. Other high-end touches included shifting gears on two F1 simulators, test-riding a pair of TESLA driverless cars and, to conclude the conference, an afternoon treasure-hunt that sent the whole 130-plus international pack out into the streets of Zurich to explore Movenpick’s Swiss roots at a competitive pace. The reviews: they laughed, they played, and they performed as a united global team. Add the unexpected. Make it memorable by making it meaningful, different and fun. Not every company or event will have a budget to offer gifts or to eat gourmet food and sip coffee-cocktails during breaks. However, that shouldn’t stop you from offering new experiences or thoughtful touches that “make moments” for your participants that are authentic to your culture. The tip: consider what matters to your team, then be generous. Visuals matter. Slide design and space were key in the success of this event. Too many conferences invest time and money in other important areas but forget the essential role of visuals to support key messages on stage. Movenpick limited text to under 10words/slide and asked presenters to make decks as graphic, clear and simple as possible. When speakers needed a creative boost, we were there to design and animate with them. The key: visuals matter, from slides to attire and certainly the event space.  Speaking of the actual space, Movenpick broke the mold and accentuated their culture shift within their hotel design by putting participants in a more modern yet homey setup. Couches and armchairs replaced stiff banquet seating, reflecting the future feel of their lobbies.\nEvents are not brain science. It’s about starting early and being thorough from the bottom to the top. You need the right materials and a clear plan to build a masterpiece.\nInvolve key stakeholders. Work from your core objectives and add layers of meaning and originality in stages. Above all, stay true to who you are as an organization. Authenticity is key.\nOne more thing. What made Movenpick’s SHIFT 2018 conference truly amazing, was that the leadership team and organizers continuously put themselves in the shoes of their audience: the GMs. They thought from their perspective and their needs. Serve your audience and you will smile at the results.\nChavy’s event team took risks to walk their talk: they were honest, dynamic and prepared enough to let loose on D-Day. It was clear that they were proud to work at Movenpick, and that pride was reflected in their audience.\nSo, in organizing your next event, we hope you feel clearer and more inspired about how to approach it. And, if you’d like some experienced partners to help guide you on the journey, you know where to find us.\nThe Results Here is a brief interview with Olivier Chavy two weeks after SHIFT 2018:\nHow did you feel the event went from a leadership perspective? The overall atmosphere of the conference was what we were most interested in and we wanted people to leave with the sensation ‘wow, I am really proud to work for this company’. The reactions we have received so far lead us to believe this was a mission accomplished!\nWhat did your general managers have to say about the event? The most common feedback has been that this was the best GM conference they have ever attended, which is fantastic. Most delegates commented that they liked the unusual format of short, sharp sessions – not too long sitting in a hall and no numbers presented.\nWhat made SHIFT a memorable experience? The whole ambiance made it memorable but there were a lot of memorable ‘little touches’ that came together to achieve this. From everyone wearing Converse high top shoes, to the newspaper we created, to the cool partners who presented, to the Swiss cow-bell awards…. We took some risks and did things differently and it paid off.\nWhen did you start planning the conference and why did you bring in Ideas on Stage to support you? We started planning initially in summer 2017 but the real work began in October/November that year. We decided to bring Ideas on Stage on board as we knew we didn’t want to do a ‘traditional’ conference and we would need professional assistance to stage manage, coach our speakers and plan the sessions.\nHow did working with Ideas on Stage help in realizing the event? It was critical – we would not have achieved the impact we did without them. Every one of our speakers was coached and guided into how to make the most of their session, all content was aligned to ensure the messages we wanted were passed, they came up with great ideas for transitions, flow of sessions, themes. We are really pleased we brought them on board.\nWere you surprised by any aspect of the event, before, during or after? We were surprised that we could enjoy it and not stress too much, it went really smoothly.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"cbe5d1252e570d28584d9060e1fe19fe","tags":["events","amazing","culture","shift","how","tips","learning","study"],"title":"What Makes an Amazing, Culture-Shifting Event?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/05/15/2019-05-15-what-makes-an-amazing-culture-shifting-event/"},{"author":"The Ideas on Stage team","categories":["london","events"],"content":"A big part of the way many companies sell is to create a presentation that shows the complex benefits of the solution they are offering.\nBut even great businesses — which are very good at what they do — often lack the ability to clearly share their message to their target audience using presentations.\nThere are many reasons why people and companies want to improve their presentations but at the heart of it what they really want is to win more deals, get more customers and sell more.\nIn our 10-year experience of successfully helping many of the world’s leading companies sell more through radically better business presentations, there are three ingredients you must have in order to make effective presentations:\n1.

But I think it is sometimes given by coaches without thinking about the consequences, and that it can actually do more bad than good. Let me explain why.\nThe first reason is simply that not every speaker needs to speak slowly. Speaking slowly is done for several reasons, such as increasing the perceived gravitas (authority) or allowing the public to digest complex information more easily. But sometimes it’s simply not necessary and may actually reduce the effectiveness of the speech. If speaking fast is not detrimental to the clarity of the speech—that is, every word is easy to understand—and as long as the speed doesn’t make the amount of information unbearable for the listener, the first priority of a coach may not be to force a speaker to consciously slow down.\nThe second reason is that some people can be completely destabilized when forced to speak slower. It breaks a lot of things: the rhythm, the way words are articulated, the intonation, the energy in the voice, the link between the mouth muscles and the brain. This is why people who try to slow down may sound so awkward and unnatural. They are not used to it. It’s relatively easy to speak slower, it’s very hard to do so and remain natural and authentic.\nThe third reason why speaking slowly may not be good advice is that it may not be that relevant after all. The average speed at which orators speak has increased over time. Listen to a speech from Churchill, Martin Luther King or General de Gaulle and compare it to a recent speech, you should easily hear the dramatic difference in pace. Modern speeches tend to be delivered faster. Modern adverts or YouTubers speak even faster, yet manage to catch our attention and communicate clearly. Our era is so crowded with distractions every second of attention has become a luxury that cannot be wasted.\nFor master speakers, the ability to slow down or pick up pace naturally is extremely valuable, but it requires a lot of work and dedication. When there is little time to prepare, it’s more important to teach a speaker how to remain natural, authentic and passionate, and this is achieved much more easily by teaching how to speak in sync with the audience than to force someone to consciously slow down.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"3b15579520d7c1f9fc820971b2967630","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Should you actually slow down your speech when you present?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/05/07/2019-05-07-should-you-actually-slow-down-your-speech-when-you-present/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Powerful visuals come from powerful messages and clear visual ideas. But sometimes slides aren’t necessary. The days of ‘Death by PowerPoint®’ are over. Take 5 to discover the 3 simple steps to slide success that will help you achieve your objectives—and leave your audience wanting more—in our new episode of The Business Presentation Revolution podcast, with presentation experts Rose Bloomfield and Phil Waknell.\n   Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution: your colorful cocktail of presentation goodness.\nPhil: [00:00:06] Today we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on slides. Why most slides fail and three steps to make sure yours succeed.\nRose: [00:00:16] So today people really don\u0026rsquo;t like PowerPoint and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. In fact, maybe we should just stop using it?\nPhil: [00:00:24] Well we could and in fact a lot of presentations would work very well without any visual aids. And it\u0026rsquo;s much better for a presentation to have no slides than to have bad slides. But if people hate PowerPoint and the other slide technologies it\u0026rsquo;s not because of the technologies themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s because of the way they are used. And if you think that a good slide is just a whole bunch of bullet points behind you, well you can understand your audience not liking that. So, I think you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;throw out the baby with the bathwater\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not the tool, it\u0026rsquo;s the fool who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to use it that\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nRose: [00:01:01] Great. So Phil, you promised us three techniques for slide success. What\u0026rsquo;s the first one?\nPhil: [00:01:08] So the first one is to always remember that you\u0026rsquo;ve got to make sure you know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say before you start to think about your slides. The slides should illustrate what you\u0026rsquo;re saying. You are not there to comment on the slides that are behind you.\nRose: [00:01:25] OK. So first step: speech before slides. What\u0026rsquo;s the second step?\nPhil: [00:01:30] Well the second step is not to get your computer involved too early. In fact what you really need to do is to switch off your computer when you start thinking about the slides. You first think about the story, we\u0026rsquo;ve already done that. But then you think, \u0026ldquo;how do I want to illustrate that?\u0026rdquo; And you do it analog. You do it with some sticky notes or with a whiteboard or whatever, but then you can imagine what you would want to have as a visual aid to help your audience. And only then can you start designing it in your slide application of choice.\nRose: [00:02:04] Perfect. Okay, step one: speech before slides. Step two: analog storyboard first. In fact, at Ideas on Stage, the presentation directors or coaches tend to create a storyboard first, based on the key messages of our speakers, and then we deliver it to the designer. The designer is the one that makes it beautiful in PowerPoint only once we have a clear idea of where we\u0026rsquo;re going visually. So we have the first and second step. Phil, what\u0026rsquo;s our third step?\nPhil: [00:02:33] Well the third step, Rose, is absolutely to remember that slides are not documents. So yesterday I was giving a class for a business school and one of the people in the audience said that she really hates it when people confuse slides and documents. When they confuse PowerPoint with Word. And this is a problem. We often produce really bad slides because we think we can kill two birds with one stone. Like the slide that is going to be on the wall behind us while we\u0026rsquo;re speaking is also a document that we can distribute before or during or after the presentation. And you know what? Slides don\u0026rsquo;t make good documents and documents don\u0026rsquo;t make good slides. The more text you put up there in an attempt to make it useful for someone reading afterwards, well you know what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen? The audience will try to read; and human beings cannot read and listen at the same time. Right?\nRose: [00:03:31] Absolutely.\nPhil: [00:03:32] Not even ladies can do that Rose, can they?\nRose: [00:03:34] No, I know we\u0026rsquo;re great multitaskers, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty hard to do both at the same time. So we have three successful steps for designing effective slides. One: speech before the slides. Two: analog storyboard first. Three: don\u0026rsquo;t confuse your slides with a document. So separate those two.\nPhil: [00:03:57] So once we\u0026rsquo;ve understood that your slides are only visual aids during our presentation and that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to distribute them because we have documents, well then we can design them effectively. But that is for another show.\nRose: [00:04:10] So thank you for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We have a lot more to share with you about delivery and slides.

Now, Gizmodo is not exactly known as a staple of great journalism, but sometimes they have a knack to hit the nail on the head. In this case, the fact that for several years Elon Musk repeatedly promised—and failed to deliver—full autonomous driving. Honestly, s eeing how hard it is to achieve full autonomy, and how many problems are left with Tesla’s current autopilot system, it is hard to believe these new promises will actually materialize.\nBut what interests me here is the relationship between what we promise and how that affects our credibility. Whenever we present, it’s easy and sexy to (over) sell grand visions of a glorious future. It makes us feel good to be that visionary genius. There’s just one problem. If we don’t deliver, then we’re just freeing a pack of wild dogs that one day will come back to bite us. This is exactly the trap in which Elon Musk has fallen.\nHe is not alone. During his first tenure at Apple, Steve Jobs was known for always over-inflating sales predictions, and failing to meet them. The lackluster sales of Macintosh compared to his promises were one of the reasons for his downfall. It would take him another failure, NeXT, and again another one with the Mac Cube, to drastically change his approach and start to under-promise, over-deliver.\nThe overpromise, under-deliver approach is typical of startups, because the competition is so fierce to stand out and gain an edge against the competition that it is sometimes necessary to have blind faith in your own vision. But Tesla is not a little startup anymore, and Elon Musk needs to change the way he communicates about it. He should start to under-promise and over-deliver. If he does so, it will be very easy for him to reclaim the lost credibility.\nHe’s totally capable of it. In fact, what is truly confounding is that he is already doing it brilliantly with Space X. He’s achieved a huge breakthrough in space technology, yet does not hesitate to warn before each launch that chances of failure remain extremely high. Under-promise, over-deliver.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"509683db72d8fef66a8cb698f7c1a208","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"Is Elon Musk running out of credibility?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/04/30/2019-04-30-is-elon-musk-running-out-of-credibility/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Debate","TEDx","Fear","Prise de parole en public","Débat","Peur"],"content":"This is a quick list of seven common problems that we see with slides created by non specialists. However they are relatively easy to spot, and you don’t have to be a graphic designer to avoid them. Read on and your next slides will look much better!\n Too much content. The goal is not to cover every single inch with content. It’s not because you have some space left at the bottom of the slide that you should put something there. Leave ample white space, let your content breathe, it will give it importance. Irrelevant content. Now that you removed clutter, it’s time to ask yourself if the remaining content is really, really, really necessary and relevant to your presentation and to what you are going to say. Irrelevant content will just distract and confuse your audience. Content is too small. The basic rule is: if it’s too small to be readable, don’t put it on the slide. What’s the point of adding text in 9 points that nobody will be able to read? Even if relevant, if it cannot be read by your audience then it’s just visual noise. When designing your slides, take the size of the room and of the screen into account. If you are young don’t forget that older people often don’t see as well as you do, and need bigger text and graphics. Illogical visual flow. We have seen slides that put the key information in the bottom right corner. Or slides that had to be read bottom to top. Try to avoid those layouts if possible, in Western culture it’s preferable to put the most important elements at the top or center of the slide. Insufficient contrast. What looks legible on your high quality screen may look washed out on old projectors or brightly lit rooms. Always make sure that you have excellent contrast between background and content. Avoid busy backgrounds which reduce legibility. Don’t forget that white text, not colored text, is what offers the highest contrast on a dark background. Boring looking. You will just make your life unnecessary hard if you try to use boring, plain slides to keep your audience interested. Using beautiful pictures, original graphics, a small dose of animation and a few surprises will be much more efficient! Comic Sans. Please, don’t use that font. Even as a joke. Just don’t.

She’s the author of the Pyramid Principle, a book that was long considered, and sometimes still is, the gold standard of presentation structuring in the consulting industry. But it was back in the eighties. So I’ll dare to ask the question: is the pyramid principle outdated?\nIf you’re not familiar with the pyramid principle, it is a method to lay out the information in a presentation in the most efficient way possible, based on how people with little time, especially executives, absorb information. For example, one of the key techniques is to start by presenting the conclusion first, because the CEO doesn’t want to wait until the end to understand where you’re going. This, and the other techniques in the book, are still valid. They still work today. However, they are no longer sufficient to win the deal in the twenty-first century. Let me explain why.\nThe pyramid principle is an extremely logical approach. But recent research, and honestly, what the best presenters and showmen have always known, is that presentations need more than logic and information. They need emotion to be truly effective and have a lasting impact. This is where the pyramid principle falls short. We’re not just brains. We’re living humans, with our knowledge, our beliefs, our feelings, our emotions, our hopes, our fears. None of these parts can work independently from the others. Seemingly innocuous information can create fear or hope. Our audience’s beliefs—for example that centralization is a good or bad thing—can hugely influence the outcome of a presentation.\nThis is the key reason why we developed the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool, to make sure that presentations don’t treat an audience as a collection of isolated brains, but as what they are: humans. Let me show you how much of a difference that makes by going quickly through the four areas that the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool addresses:\n What people know: this is the rational information. It’s what the pyramid principle does brilliantly. What people think: this is what people think they know, but hasn’t been backed by facts. It touches on our beliefs, the rumor we heard, the “fact” that was repeated but never demonstrated. If you take the time to adapt your communication to what people think, you will instantly understand how to overcome some of the mental blocks of your audience. No more frustration because people seem to be totally deaf to your recommendations. What people feel: can you imagine how many politicians, how many top CEOs, how many celebrities would have been saved from huge embarrassment, or worse, from a debacle, if they had taken the time to take their audience’s feelings into account before speaking. What people do: too many presentations stop at “we said what we wanted to say.” It’s completely insufficient. This is what leads to: “Our presentation was great but they didn’t do what we expected” (didn’t buy, didn’t implement, didn’t sign off, didn’t whatever you wanted). But if you take the time to clearly define what you want people do after the presentation, then you can have a plan.  The pyramid principle is an excellent tool to communication logical information, but it doesn’t really take into account how humans actually work. It’s like trying to drive a car by just steering the wheel with the engine shut off. It’s not going to get you very far. By addressing your audience as humans, not machines, you will dramatically increase your chances of reaching your goal.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f2e51f408b890482799bef73eac47d33","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling","Consulting"],"title":"Is Barbara Minto’s pyramid principle outdated?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/04/16/2019-04-16-is-barbara-minto-s-pyramid-principle-outdated/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Microsoft PowerPoint","Apple Keynote","iPhone"],"content":"Recently my computer, a MacBook Pro, needed to be repaired. I had to do without a laptop for several weeks. And of course, during those weeks I needed to present with slides. Luckily, with my iPhone and a couple of accessories I had everything I needed:\n A (not too old) iPhone or iPad A lightning to HDMI adapter A lightning power cable and brick (using the HDMI adapter drains the battery fast). Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for iOS Optionally, a Logitech Spotlight remote.  Both Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote work like their computer cousins, and support all animations. I loaded my presentation on my iPhone, connected it to the screen using the HDMI adapter, and voilà! Probably the fastest and easiest way to project something. Even cooler, the iPhone supports the Logitech Spotlight presentation remote via Bluetooth, so I could use it to go advance the slides.\nThe only downside is that an iPhone screen is very small for my old eyes, and I had to turn my back to the audience from time to time to see where I was in the presentation. But it worked flawlessly.\nIf you have a critical presentation to deliver, using your iPhone as a backup is an excellent way to fight Murphy’s Law, and have a safety net in case something goes wrong with your computer.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"ec95d100971d003a4cdb3d75e5b0c038","tags":["Public Speaking","Microsoft PowerPoint","Apple Keynote","iPhone"],"title":"Use your iPhone as backup for important presentations","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/04/09/2019-04-09-use-your-iphone-as-backup-for-important-presentations/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Preparation"],"content":"Seth Godin coined the term “meatball sundae” several years ago in a book that explained that putting two great things together does not always create something better. And in the worst case, such as a meatball sundae, it can actually create something nobody wants.\nThe meatball sundae presentation effect can happen at two levels: at the event level, and at the individual presentation level.\nLet’s take Apple’s latest keynote as an example of the meatball sundae effect at the event level. Apple is a great meatball. Hollywood A-stars are great sundaes. But put together, the tastes of the two clashed in a way that was obvious to the most casual observers.\nWe can all learn something from what happened. Apple failed to create a fantastic event with the appearance of stars such as Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston. In fact, it was a worse event compared to their usual standards. So why would hiring a star magically turn our events into something fantastic? The answer is simple: it doesn’t. More prestigious? Yes. Better and more interesting? Not necessarily.\nA star can make your event better, if, and that’s a big if, properly selected and prepared. This is why, whenever we design an event, we take extra steps to ensure that your A-list guests do not taste like the meatball in the sundae. We check that they are willing to do their homework, prepare properly and that they will adapt to your audience. This makes a world of difference.\nAt the individual presentation level, the meatball sundae effect is very real too, especially when we try to cram to much stuff into too little time. Does the presentation deliver information that is at the same time too complex for non-experts and too simple for real experts? Meatball sundae presentation. Is the storyline trying to follow too many different structures and logical paths? Meatball sundae story. Does it mix different visual styles that don’t go well together? Meatball sundae slides.\nMeatball sundae presentations are often the consequence of a poorly done ABC: knowing who the Audience is (A), what are their Burning needs (B) and what is the general Context \u0026copy;. These elements have to be crystal clear before working on the story, or the presentation will lack focus and seem out of place.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"5c526878eabcf819c18b0c18b0d6ec09","tags":["Public Speaking","Preparation"],"title":"The meatball sundae presentation effect","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/04/02/2019-04-02-the-meatball-sundae-presentation-e/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"content":"It may sound weird, but this is a question we get asked from time to time: “Do you know a prescription drug that would help me reduce my stress on stage?”\nWe’re not talking about illegal drugs, but legal drugs sold in pharmacies. There are a lot of those designed by pharmaceutical companies to reduce stress, anxiety, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, etc. We are not doctors, so we cannot say anything about them from a medical perspective. But in the context of presentations, we don’t recommend any. We met a few people who unfortunately thought they couldn’t do without them. Looking back at their performance, we don’t think the drugs had any positive effect. They may have thought that it improved their performance on stage, but it didn’t. As the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Nile Rodgers once explained in an interview in the Guardian:\n “(…) My drugs made me think it was amazing. The people freaking out made me think it was amazing. My beautiful date made me think it was amazing. But the tapes don’t lie. It was not amazing. (\u0026hellip;)” —Nile Rodgers\n Of course Nile Rodgers was probably referring to something a bit stronger than Aspirin, but his lesson remains true for any kind of stage performance. Great presentation delivery requires your full presence and an authentic connection with the audience. Drugs will only set you off balance and give you a distorted view of reality, preventing you from being yourself, centered and focused on the moment.\nIn fact, you already may be taking a drug that makes things worse: coffee. Find out why that’s not a good idea in this short podcast.\nAfter working with thousands of speakers, our message is clear: you don’t need drugs to present successfully, but you do need energy. A good presentation coach will help you turn your fear into positive energy, helping you achieve full presence on stage, and giving your messages the power they—and your audience—deserve.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"3a326cf43eb7f666c8511dd732444cf7","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"Is there a drug to get rid of my fear of public speaking?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/03/26/2019-03-26-is-there-a-drug-to-get-rid-of-my-fear-of-public-speaking/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"content":"It’s a trick I learned when studying how movies and TV shows are written. You don’t do a flash back, you do a flash present. For presentations, that means that you don’t tell the story as something that is over; that makes the audience passive. Instead, you bring the scene from the past into the present, or you bring the audience to the past, and tell it as if it is happening right now. This allows the audience to actively relive the scene as it happened, and is a much more effective way to tell stories.\nLet me give you an example to show you the difference. Imagine you want to talk about that “aha” moment you had several years ago when you found the big idea to create your company.\nFirst, the flash back version, told as something that happened in the past: “In 2005, I had the idea to create my company. It was about creating a platform to engage users by sharing social content based on pictures only. I had the idea during a discussion with two friends. At the time most social platforms forced users to use text…”\nNow the flash present version, told as something happening now: “let’s all go back to 2005. I am having a beer with two friends. I’m complaining about how social media forces me to write something for every post. One of my friends, you know, the blunt one, tells me ‘then why don’t you create a platform where it is impossible to write something?’”…\nNote that it is possible to use the past tense (I was having a discussion…) as long as you make the public relive the scene instead of telling about it as something that is over. Where a flashback is factual and flat, a flash present is engaging and dynamic. For master storytellers, each detail matters. This technique makes a big difference when engaging your audience.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"34c5b348e6ba991242b15f1e728c97bc","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"In presentations, don’t do a flash back, do a flash present","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/03/19/2019-03-19-in-presentations-dont-do-a-flash/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["News","Ideas on Stage","UK","United Kingdom","London"],"content":"This March Andrea Pacini joined Ideas on Stage as UK Presentation Director, meaning that Ideas on Stage now has a direct presence in France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom - and we serve the rest of the world from these four locations.\nWe sat down with Andrea for a short interview.\nQ: What is your background? A: I am Italian, and I studied in Italy and Ireland. I then did an internship in Cambridge, where I fell in love with the UK and decided to stay there. I’ve been living in London for 6 years now. From a professional perspective, my background is sales and business development for international companies. In parallel I have worked to help others deliver great presentations.\nQ: What made you so interested in helping others deliver great presentations? A: The moment was ten years ago, when I read Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds. This is when I realized there was so much more than just PowerPoint. But more than that, I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur. As a kid, I used to follow people like Richard Branson, trying to learn the tips and tricks to be successful. I still read a lot of business books. I then realized that all great entrepreneurs are top communicators. And that’s when I switched my interest from pure entrepreneurship to presentations. It then led me to the realization that most business presentations suck! This is why I decided to help business people improve their presentations. What really fires me up, my passion, is the place where business intersects with communication.\nQ: What made you want to join the Ideas on Stage team? A: Like I said, Presentation Zen helped to open my eyes to what the potential of a well thought out and designed presentation could look like. Fine. But the entrepreneur in me wanted to apply this wisdom in business situations. This is how I came to discover Ideas on Stage. With their business backgrounds, Pierre and Phil and their great team pioneered the path of taking Presentation Zen principles and applying them to the entrepreneurial and business space. This ticked both my boxes. Then as a bonus, I discovered the close relationship between Garr and Ideas on Stage. So when I finally decided to turn my presentation hobby into a new career, joining Ideas on Stage was the best-case scenario for me. And I was right – we are so closely aligned that it seems like we have been working together for many years already.\nQ: Do you prefer to work with smaller or bigger companies? A: It doesn’t really matter, I love to work with both! The challenges are different, but all companies, regardless of their size, have a big weakness in the preparation phase. Everybody starts working on their presentation by opening PowerPoint, and forget that they first have to know what their objective is, identify the key messages and build a storyline before working on the slides.\nQ: Do you think the preparation phase is where most companies fail? A: Definitely. You really have to start by understanding who is your audience, what do they want from you, what’s the context of the presentation, what’s your objective, how are you going to brainstorm to refine your key messages? The preparation phase is really where the magic happens. Especially in large companies, people think a presentation is a bunch of bullet points in PowerPoint.\nQ: Is there anything companies could learn from events like TEDx? A: Oh yes, TEDx has been instrumental in helping to improve presentations. So why not take the ingredients that make a TEDx speech so engaging, and apply them to your business presentations? Business presentations don’t have to be boring! Of course a successful boardroom presentation won’t be exactly like a TEDx talk, but like TEDx it should be short, simple, well-structured, with good use of examples, and delivered convincingly.\nQ: Something else you are passionate about? A: I love craft beer! You know, beers produced by microbreweries. Just like every presentation should be original and different, with a focus on quality not quantity, I think the same way about beer! I love to discover different beers, and I go to beer tours to find new and original tastes.\nThank you and welcome Andrea, we’re delighted to have you on board.

Would you put the cart before the horse? Most people do. But fear not, the latest episode of the Business Presentation Revolution Podcast is here to help! Take just five minutes to learn about the simple change that will put the horse before the cart, and you in the driver’s seat. Join Rose as she discusses a foolproof process to prepare a presentation with Phil Waknell, Co-Founder and Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage.\n   Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your quick coffee break to learn how to shake up and wake up your presentations. [00:00:06][5.8]\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at one of the smallest but most important changes you can make to make a huge difference in your presentations. And it\u0026rsquo;s all about putting “the horse” before “the cart”. [00:00:16][9.5]\nRose: [00:00:20] You just mentioned “carts” and “horses”: what does that have to do with presentations? [00:00:24][3.4]\nPhil: [00:00:25] Well Rose, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard the expression \u0026lsquo;putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;, which is generally something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. But that\u0026rsquo;s what we do all the time when we\u0026rsquo;re preparing presentations. The typical way to prepare a business presentation is: *\u0026ldquo;Oh no, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do a presentation. Tomorrow. And it\u0026rsquo;s 11:30 at night. OK, so I am going to open my computer. I am going to type my PowerPoint slides and 50 slides later, I then think, OK, maybe I need some extra sub-bullets or whatever.\u0026rdquo;* And then what happens is the next day you get into the meeting room, you say hi to everybody, you connect your computer, you start showing your slides, you turn your back on the audience, you read your bullet points, and then you improvise because you haven\u0026rsquo;t prepared what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say. You end up with a whole lot of information and it\u0026rsquo;s boring as hell for the participants. I mean, how do you feel when you\u0026rsquo;re in that audience? [00:01:15][50.3]\nRose: [00:01:17] Well, unfortunately, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been there before and you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the emails you still have to answer. You\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the groceries you need to buy tonight, and why didn\u0026rsquo;t this guy prepare? Here I am and where is he? [00:01:29][12.2]\nPhil: [00:01:30] Absolutely. So you think you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared the presentation but actually you\u0026rsquo;ve not. You\u0026rsquo;ve just prepared some bullet points, which your audience is going to hate and which they\u0026rsquo;re going to forget very quickly. So that is not a proper preparation, but it is ‘putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;. So, if you think about it, ‘putting the cart before the horse’ is going through the process in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is putting the horse before the cart and that means we need to work out what we have to say to our audience, and then afterwards we think: \u0026ldquo;do I need to illustrate that? And if so, how?\u0026rdquo; So preparation for a presentation, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve got limited time - because people always say to us: \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to prepare my presentation properly, so I just have to prepare my slides.\u0026rdquo; No. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a short time, then what you should do is to be thinking: Who is my audience? What are their needs? What are my objectives? And what are the few things they need to remember a week later for me to achieve those objectives? And then you\u0026rsquo;ve got your key messages. You understand your objectives, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have slides you\u0026rsquo;re prepared. If you have your slides but you don\u0026rsquo;t know your key messages, you\u0026rsquo;re not prepared. [00:02:44][74.2]\nRose: [00:02:45] That\u0026rsquo;s it. And luckily we face this all the time at Ideas on Stage, so we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a very simple four step process. One: you ideate. What is this going to be about? What do I need to say? Like Phil mentioned: objectives, key messages. Two: you need to create your presentation. Write it out. Write your storyline. Three: ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I need illustrations? Do I need slides?\u0026rdquo; If you do then you make them! If you don\u0026rsquo;t, fine. Especially in those tight moments when you only have one night to prepare, you might not need the slides. Four: delivery; speaking. That\u0026rsquo;s when you can start to time yourself and check if you know what you need to say ahead. And your audience will thank you. [00:03:31][46.7]\nPhil: [00:03:32] That makes a huge, huge difference. So I will always say rehearsal is necessary. Slides are optional. So if you go into a meeting, if you go into a presentation and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any PowerPoint slides but you do have clear messages and you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable in front of your audience because you have rehearsed it two, three, four, five times then your audience will actually enjoy that far more than a whole load of bullet points behind you. [00:04:00][27.7]\nRose: [00:04:00] Yep. So let\u0026rsquo;s put the \u0026lsquo;horse BEFORE the cart\u0026rsquo;. Prepare. You\u0026rsquo;ve got Ideation, Creation, maybe Illustration and then Speaking and you\u0026rsquo;ll be set. [00:04:09][8.8]\nPhil: [00:04:10] As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u0026rdquo; Creating a lot of slides and bullet points without knowing what you want to say is not preparation, that\u0026rsquo;s an absence of preparation. So if you prepare it properly, if you go into the meeting knowing what you need to say, knowing your objectives, even without slides, you will succeed and your audience will thank you.

This is the reason you, and not somebody else, is on stage to deliver the presentation. The second stake is about your audience: why is it important for them? This is the reason why your audience is there to listen to you instead of doing something else. This is why they should care about your topic. The third stake is about everyone else: why does it truly matter outside of the audience and you? What is the impact of your topic on the world?  If you forget the first stake, then you will not feel engaged. If you forget the second stake, then your audience will not be interested. If you forget the third stake, then nobody else will care about your presentation.\nTake for example a talk about the environmental impact of plastic bottles. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care about that topic, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the first stake. Most probably you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be on stage. The second stake is about \u0026ldquo;why is the topic of plastic bottles important for you, the audience?\u0026rdquo; Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s so we each realize how much plastic we waste each year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because it has direct consequences on our health. The third stake brings perspective. It shows that the problem is not just about a bunch of people in the room, but impacts everyone, even living organisms that are located thousands of kilometers from where the bottle was thrown away. These organisms are essential for our own survival.\nGreat presentations are delivered by someone who cares, to people who will care, about something worth caring about. If the stakes are low, nothing much will happen. If all three stakes are high, then you give yourself a chance of making an impact.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"e2c3681b4bae7b501730c0cdb95f3376","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Storytelling"],"title":"The triple stakes of great presentations","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/03/05/2019-03-05-triple-stakes-of-great-presentations/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"content":"“Don’t worry, I’m experienced, I speak at conferences all the time!” How many times have we heard that sentence from speakers who never did a TEDx style talk, yet think that, because of experience, they can just wing it? For us, it’s not reassuring. Quite the opposite, it’s a clear warning sign that the speaker doesn’t really know what is expected of him. Here are five warning signs that give you clues that your speaker may not be ready to give a TEDx style talk.\n Thinking that traditional speaking experience can replace TEDx specific preparation. We’ve seen many speakers who were very good at giving unstructured talks, or 1h presentations, or improvise during a round table. But giving a TEDx Talk requires a whole different level of commitment and preparation. Make sure your speaker understands what is expected of him. Constantly changing the key topic, storyline or angle. Some speakers seem to be unable to discipline themselves to stick to the planned storyline. They constantly change their mind. After several weeks of preparation they come up with draft version 2453 of their talk, but it’s not better than draft version 1. And on D Day, they want to change their story again. Not putting in the necessary hours to prepare. Nobody can deliver a breakthrough talk without preparing and rehearsing properly. It’s just not possible. Those speakers doing OK Without preparation? They just rehash what they usually say. They don’t cover new ground. They don’t bring new ideas to the table. They just missed a big opportunity to innovate. Not wanting to adapt his presentation. Some speakers are unwilling to move away from what they usually do. Because of the fear of the unknown, the fear of change, or just plain stubbornness. They may not be the best person to speak at your TEDx event. Too passionate to keep an open mind. I have seen several activists who were so passionate about the cause they were defending that they couldn’t conceive others did not necessarily share their views. They spoke passionately about their fight, de facto excluding everyone who didn’t share their point of view, and creating a feeling of aggression in the majority of the public.  In collaboration with the presentation directors, the curator of the event has the responsibility to look for these clues, and if necessary axe the speaker from the program. It’s much better to remove one speaker from the show, even if he’s already announced on the program, than take the risk of a disaster on stage.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"43200e4a7e1771afe65190ce831d4275","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"5 warning signs someone is not ready to speak at your TEDx event","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/02/26/2019-02-26-5-warning-signs-someone-is-not-ready-for-ted/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Pitch","Startup"],"content":"If you’re a Startup founder, you’ve heard this all before. “Your elevator pitch should be able to convince anyone in 30 seconds in an elevator”.

We saw that the best way to fend them off is to strengthen your vital space anchor. But how can you do that?\nIf your presentation has an objective, a clear message, it is much easier to use it as an anchor. Let’s imagine for example that the key message is that your presentation is about a new software service that offers necessary services to protect your IT systems. But the vultures—who don’t really understand what it’s about—are out to eat the tech guy. They question every choice, every detail, every functionality. The presentation turns into an endless discussion of details. If that happens, re-anchor the presentation. Remind them of the objective, the message: “Yes, we can discuss about whether we can add the animated dog on the configuration page later, but this is secondary. What is really important is that we guarantee that we have the right level of protection, and this is the best tool to do it.”\nBullies also like to behave like spoiled children. They throw themselves on the ground, kicking and screaming (mostly figuratively, I haven’t seen someone actually throw himself on the ground—that would have been interesting—but I heard plenty of people screaming to try to cover the sound of their incompetence). They won’t take no as an answer. You know what? No is exactly the answer they need, with a short sentence explaining the consequences, no more. For example: “No, we cannot add this because this would increase the budget / increase the risk / increase delivery time.” The longer your justification is, the more it becomes self-justification, the weaker it becomes, the more mouth-watering you become to the vultures. Be sure to do this only for unjustified requests, not for legitimate concerns or needs. Instead of being the prey, you become the bully’s super nanny. You’re the adult in the room, anchored, with a good message to defend. When you do that, something funny happens. Most bullies instinctively understand they’re starting to look immature and are going to lose their power, and they calm down by themselves. Only the slower ones don’t get it. Be kind to them.\nThe vultures will also try to destabilize you with questions you don’t have the answer. Although not being able to answer any question means you’re not prepared properly (and in that case that’s your problem, not the bully’s problem), it’s perfectly fine and normal not to have 100% of the answers. Just say it. “I don’t have the answer, we will test it and I will come back to you.” See? That simple. You even behaved proactively by proposing to find the answer to the question.\nThese are only a few examples of the techniques you can use to get out of a presentation slump and gain confidence. Anybody willing to invest the time and effort can change and become a good presenter. This is also what a good coach can do for you.

Don’t forget to ask these essential questions to be sure you don’t fail before you’ve even started to speak.\n   Transcript Phil: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your double espresso of presentation know-how.\nRose: [00:00:05] This episode is all about the magic ingredient in any presentation: Your Audience.\nPhil: [00:00:12] So Rose, when I ask people what they hate most about presentations, one thing that comes up all the time is that they hate it when they\u0026rsquo;re receiving a standard presentation, which just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it is suited to that audience.\nRose: [00:00:27] Exactly, Phil. I often think of it like Christmas. So think of your presentation like a gift. Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at Christmas and you\u0026rsquo;re opening your gift and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. You pull off the bow and you look around and at the same time you all pull out\u0026hellip; the same pair of socks. And you realize, \u0026ldquo;Mom, you probably could have done better than all of us having the same pair of socks.\u0026rdquo;\nRose: [00:00:49] Maybe when you\u0026rsquo;re giving gifts you think about what would actually mean something to your grandmother and what would actually mean something to your kids. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;the socks.” So Phil, we have some methodology we use at Ideas on Stage that helps us think about the necessary questions to prepare a presentation for an audience. Can you tell us about that?\nPhil: [00:01:08] Absolutely Rose. So we always start with the ABC. Audience. Burning need. Context. It\u0026rsquo;s the first step. It\u0026rsquo;s so important. And most presenters don\u0026rsquo;t do it. So first off: who is your audience? And you need to get to know your audience beyond simply the title on their business card. Who are they really? I had one chief executive who came to me for example for help with a presentation at a conference and I asked him, \u0026ldquo;So, who\u0026rsquo;s in the audience?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;OK well come back when you do because I can\u0026rsquo;t help you to prepare a successful presentation if we don\u0026rsquo;t know who the audience is.\u0026rdquo; Because the audience is the magic ingredient. So the second part then is the burning need.\nRose: [00:01:53] Oh yes. Your example makes me think. I was working with someone the other day as well and I asked, \u0026ldquo;So, when you\u0026rsquo;re preparing this presentation, what is your team expecting from you in the presentation? Do they need to know numbers? Do they need some moral support? Do they need some reassurance?\u0026rdquo; I looked at him: “[he said] I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Same thing. I said, \u0026ldquo;Okay can you find out? Because this is what\u0026rsquo;s going to guide you in preparing an effective presentation.\u0026rdquo; What are their needs from you? Of course, what is your objective? But what are they expecting?\nPhil: [00:02:27] Yes, you\u0026rsquo;ve always got to start from where they are. That\u0026rsquo;s vital. So often when we\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC with a client they will find that they actually ****don\u0026rsquo;t know some of this information, but they know that they need to find it out. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just asking the right questions. So the \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; then is for context. This is all about how long the presentation is supposed to be. Will there be questions and answers afterwards? Is there somebody else presenting before? If so, what are they presenting? Is there someone presenting afterwards? What time of day is it going to be? For example, is it first thing in the morning? Which is good for getting people to really understand things. Is it first thing in the afternoon? In which case, good luck… All of these things: the technology you have available. Do you have a projector? Do you have sound? Lots of different questions that will help you to understand the context. It\u0026rsquo;s also your audience\u0026rsquo;s business context: is their business going well? Is it not going well? Where are they in the financial cycle? In the sales context: do they already have a supplier? Do they already work with you? All of these things you need to know. And you\u0026rsquo;ll find that when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC it\u0026rsquo;s always just asking the simple but really important questions. And it\u0026rsquo;s the five most important minutes that you can ever spend when preparing a presentation.\nRose: [00:03:45] Excellent Phil. When is this presentation going to happen? Who is it with? I completely agree. So remember: this is not your presentation, it\u0026rsquo;s theirs. The magic ingredient in any presentation is: the Audience. Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s the magic ingredient in your presentation.\nPhil: [00:04:06] Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We\u0026rsquo;ve got so much more to share.

You didn’t manage to shake off your nerves. You became confused. The client or your boss criticized you. Maybe you’ve been caught in a downward spiral for some time, each criticism making you lose confidence, and making the next presentation worse. I have good news for you: no matter what your situation is, this vicious circle can be broken, and you gain the necessary confidence to enjoy presenting.\nHaters are going to hate Before I explain how, let’s put things into context. Haters are going to hate. Some people have a psychological problem, and are there to put others down. This can be to mask their own insecurities and problems, or it can be because they like to bully others. Unfortunately, those types seem to thrive in certain work environments. Stop feeling guilty right now because of these people. They are the ones who have a problem, not you. If that describes your boss, he’s not behaving like the leader he could be. If that describes your client, he does not behave like the competent client he could be. I’m fine with people giving me blunt, critical but honest feedback, even if it may be hard to hear. But I won’t accept people using criticism and attacks to put others down, and nobody should. I will also give you another secret: these vultures are really not that strong. They build their power on charm, fear and submission. But they are hated by everyone. Their subordinates. Their fellow managers or C-level executives. Even their bosses hate them. At the first opportunity everybody will jump ship and abandon them. Once you start to understand that, they are really not that fearsome anymore.\nI started by addressing this point because, in my experience, this is really the factor that makes people doubt themselves and lose their presentation powers. In a secure environment, you feel alright, but as soon as you see the shadows of the vultures circling above your head, you lose confidence. Vultures? Yes, that’s exactly what they are! They are scavengers, they like to prey on perceived weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but they’re really not that courageous. To starve the vultures, you just need to show you are alive and ready to stand firm. How? By strengthening your anchor in your vital space.\nThe goal of the vultures is to reduce your vital space or push you out of it. The vultures are circling around your vital space, they are always trying to invade it by stealing your energy and confidence. It’s only a facade. If you remain anchored, your vital space will protect you and you will be able to fend off all threats with calm and confidence. It will become a natural part of your presentations. Being able to jump out of your vital space is useful, but don’t do it before you have the confidence to do so and learn to do it without turning into a vulture.\nIn the second part I will explain several techniques to stay anchored and protect your vital space, and scare off the presentation vultures.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"d0e0b5a4d67af00b57b74e810fbb9fb8","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 1)","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/02/05/2019-02-05-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-1/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Training","Krauthammer","Presentations"],"content":"A few weeks ago, Ideas on Stage had the privilege of organizing a sales presentation training for Krauthammer at Dolce La Hulpe, close to Brussels in Belgium. For us, delivering a training for dozens of senior people at Krauthammer, one of the world’s most respected sales and management training companies, felt like designing something for Jonathan Ive, Apple’s legendary designer: a bit intimidating but incredibly exciting.\nThe training met with great success, and it was fantastic to work with such talented people, but what I will remember most are two presentations. During the hands-on course, groups prepared a sales pitch, and at the end of the day, each group had to deliver its presentation in front of the others.\nThe first group was stunning! The beginning of the presentation used the music from “Also sprach Zarathustra” from Richard Strauss, the piece you hear in the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey when mankind discovers the use of tools. Not speaking at all, just pointing to a few words at a time on the slides to deliver his key message. He had his audience’s attention fully captured!\nBoy, was the second group in trouble. How can you beat such a brilliant presentation? Well, the second presenter calmly and confidently went on stage. And started singing the tune of “Also sprach Zarathustra” live! Everybody, impressed by his boldness and his clever and humorous improvisation, feeling fully connected and present, started singing along. Using great body language to increase the dramatic effect, he stole the show. After doing this he simply said “This is how we do it at Krauthammer. We don’t do playback, we always do it live!” Everybody laughed and had a great time. This is exactly the kind of presentation they will still remember and talk about next year, whereas countless other boring presentations will have been long forgotten.\nThey probably won’t do that in front of a real client. But they will remember the need to be memorable. By default, your audience will forget everything you say—fast. It’s up to you to find a way to make your messages stick. (With or without singing.)\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"cf0b56390c390d9ef82c55964e41ccac","tags":["Public Speaking","Training","Krauthammer","Presentations"],"title":"How to steal the show","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/29/2019-01-29-how-to-steal-the-show/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali"],"content":"I know, paraphrasing the motto of the great Muhammad Ali, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”, doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yet my point is that in a debate it is extremely important to listen and move with a maximum of agility, and talk with a maximum of punch.\nTake the example of the Gilets jaunes controversy in France. The government was completely taken by surprise by the popularity of the movement. Their initial listening position lacked agility and guile. They were perceived as static, which gave the impression, justified or not, that they were not listening at all. Their counters used words that didn’t have any punch, believing that the threat would disappear by itself.\nOnly after receiving glancing blows to the head did they start to realize how serious their situation was, and how much their strength had already been sapped. The president tried to counter. He had good arguments and gave away a lot, but only got more attacks in return. Why? Because he used his arguments inefficiently. Instead of using them in a way that would have made the movement pause and doubt, he threw away his best shots, he gave the impression he was losing, and that gave more confidence and energy to his opponents.\nWhen under attack, if you counter weakly, it only strengthens your opponent and saps your morale. Start by floating (listening) like a butterfly, put yourself in a favorable position, then sting (speak) like a bee when the time is right.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f6421febecff76b83ba8ce3f1b522842","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali"],"title":"Listen like a butterfly, talk like a bee","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/22/2019-01-22-listen-like-a-butterfly-talk-like-a-bee/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Rose asks Phil how to overcome your fear before a big presentation, and turn it into positive energy on stage.

Phil, is everything okay?\nPhil: I\u0026rsquo;m just really feeling kind of nervous. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m properly prepared for today.\nRose: Well you\u0026rsquo;re in luck because today\u0026rsquo;s episode is all about calming presentation nerves. We all get them. (Phil, we\u0026rsquo;re recording.) So right before we were talking about how to calm presentation nerves. Before we get into some solutions, let\u0026rsquo;s take a stage fright diagnostic. Phil, can I ask you a few questions about how you feel? Is your heart racing? How\u0026rsquo;s your voice? Can you try saying something?\nPhil: It\u0026rsquo;s kind of dry and hard to get it out.\nRose: OK. Are you able to focus? Can you look straight ahead for a moment? Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to keep direct eye contact.\nPhil: I \u0026rsquo;m just too stressed.\nRose: O K, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can find where the issue arose. So, thinking about preparing for your \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; today: did you prepare in a four-part process and think about the ideas and creating the presentation?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you rehearse? Did you try to practice a few times, maybe even five or six times?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you get some sleep last night? Maybe six hours or more?\nPhil: No.\nRose: All right. And\u0026hellip; did you have coffee?\nPhil: Yes. (-Two.)\nRose: Yeah, I know you Phil. OK. So here are a few common traps and things that will absolutely activate your nerves. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that Phil?\nPhil: Well absolutely because to be honest stage fright happens to everybody. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t get stage fright you do get nerves. Now I speak in public all the time but I do get nervous before a major presentation. We all do. It was Mark Twain who said, “the world only has two categories of speakers: the nervous and the liars.” So we all get it, right? The question is, how do we make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t paralyze us and how do we actually channel that nervous energy and give that energy to our audience rather than letting it paralyze us like it did me a few moments ago.\nRose: Absolutely. And that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of where our work comes in as coaches. We work with people all the time to help them relax and get centered, but also just to learn how to prepare well. There is one other thing we didn\u0026rsquo;t touch on and this is sort of a back-pocket, secret weapon towards nerves and that is: the energy or feeling that\u0026rsquo;s running through your body coming out as trembles sometimes, this is fear. But on the other side of fear is excitement. So connecting to your purpose and what is actually exciting you about presenting, this can really help energize you in a positive way. And remember, this isn\u0026rsquo;t your presentation. This is theirs. So get out of yourself. Come back to the preparation. Avoid the coffee if you can. Get some good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prepare.\nPhil: Absolutely. Always focus not on what could go wrong but think about what could go right. Imagine your audience enjoying your presentation, getting your key messages and then achieving your objectives because it\u0026rsquo;s up to them to achieve your objectives for you. So imagine all of that happening. Visualize that happening and it helps a lot. But, you know what I find? It’s that rehearsing your presentation, knowing that that presentation is well-prepared and is going to hit the target with that audience is actually more than half the battle. The rest of it is making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not putting your body in a stressful situation by having coffee, which is wonderful if you want to be productive and creative, but it\u0026rsquo;s not great when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking because not only does it make you speak a lot faster, which actually reduces your credibility, it also dries out your throat and it increases your stress levels. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing that when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting.\nRose: So, three things to remember: one, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Everybody gets presentation nerves, even Phil. Two, prepare and rehearse. Three, take care of your body and your body will take care of you.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n You’re not alone: we all get nerves. Prepare and rehearse to turn fear into excitement. Take care of your body: avoid coffee, get good sleep, and breathe.  Phil: Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Whatever works for you.\n\u0026mdash; Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) January 8, 2019 \nThis tweet says:\n\u0026ldquo;Dear almost everyone on stage at CES: Pay ungodly amounts of money — anything you have to — to get WWDC speaker training ASAP.\nOr go to Juilliard or the Royal Shakespeare Company for a month. Whatever works for you.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you look at the comments in the thread, it seems other attendees agree with him. The average level of the talks was perceived as unprepared and boring. That\u0026rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is, if you prepare well, you have a good chance to stand out and get noticed. And we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about a small event: we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the CES, one of the biggest shows on the planet.\nWe trained people to speak at CES before, including people who felt they were great and didn\u0026rsquo;t need training. It often shocked them when we told them they were not ready, especially people nobody dared to criticize.\nWe often wonder why people invest so little time in what might be the most important thing after actually having a (good) product: their pitch or presentation. There\u0026rsquo;s no miracle. That guy who was a great showman and seemed so natural? He rehearsed – a lot. He took the time to write a great speech and illustrate it with great visuals. He took the time to rehearse, and was coached by professionals.\nYou may think you\u0026rsquo;re just going to wing it. But that won\u0026rsquo;t fly. If you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready, do this test. Ask the best presenter you know to give you honest, unfiltered feedback on your presentation. If you hesitate to do so, maybe you should ask yourself why.\nAs a post-script, if you are organizing an important event, don’t leave anything to chance. Hire a specialist team of presentation coaches, and make sure every speaker gets help with story, slides and speaking. Some speakers may need less help than others - that’s fine. But a speaker who doesn’t have the time to prepare with a coach isn’t going to prepare properly anyway, and a speaker who feels he is too important to be helped will probably be so full of himself that he won’t adapt to your audience. Neither of these speakers has any place on your stage.\nMake sure your speakers shine – otherwise, the only things people will remember from your event are tweets like Rene’s.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"4f2f1fa076a270b964998789b2d21d29","tags":["Presentation","Public Speaking","CES","Coaching"],"title":"I presented at CES and all I got was a bunch of ungrateful tweets","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/15/2019-01-14-i-presented-at-ces-and-all-i-got-was-a-bunch-of-ungrateful-tweets/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"content":"By now, you’ve probably heard that Apple was doomed. Last Wednesday they released a profit warning press release, followed by an interview with CEO Tim Cook.\nI’m all too aware of Apple’s previous profit warning. Back in the nineties, after Steve Jobs returned to Apple and a Saudi prince (whose name I forget) bought a lot of Apple shares, I decided that I would be a smart investor and I bought Apple shares too.\nThe ride went well, at least until the implosion of the internet bubble, then things got bumpy. But in 2002, after many quarters of growth, the failure of the Cube and the Mac market failing to gain more traction, Steve Jobs delivered the bad news: a profit warning that sent the price of the stock tumbling. Fed up, I sold my shares. Smart investor, my ass. If I had kept those shares, they would have been worth half a million dollars today.\nBut for us presenters, what is really interesting is the contrast between the communication styles of the two profit warnings. First, Tim Cook’s letter is more than 1300 words. In comparison, Steve’s was fewer than 200 words. It’s much easier to get the key message from 200 words than 1300. Shorter communications are much more effective. In fact, I read Steve’s profit warning very quickly, whereas I had to force myself to read through the entirety of Tim’s letter.\nWhy does this matter? It’s especially important because in such a communication, whether written or delivered during a presentation, the information you want people to pay attention to should be at the end. It follows this structure:\n Acknowledge the elephant in the room. We’re going to miss our financial guidance numbers. It doesn’t have to be long. Just tell them how much, and why. Don’t try to mess around finding pathetic excuses: that just adds more fuel to the rumor fire. Give context. Is it really just an Apple problem? No. The slowdown is affecting all players in the industry. Go in for the kill. Out of all players, Apple is the one that remains by far the most profitable, and looking ahead is in the best position to face the future.  The third point is really the key message, the one you want everybody to remember. If your delivery is too long, a lot of people will only remember the first point. That you are doomed.\nIf you have to deliver bad news in a presentation, this is how you should do it. Be as succinct as possible. Start with the bad news, provide context, then conclude with the key positive message.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b3065cf1ca6b17f1dd89f610dbf7d58b","tags":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"title":"What presentation lessons can we learn from Apple’s profit warning?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/08/2019-01-07-what-presentation-lessons-can-we-learn-from-apples-profit-warning/"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","categories":["Presentation","Tips","Transform","Prepare","Objective","Meeting","Impact","Efficient"],"content":"Too many presentations aim only to inform, yet this is one thing oral presentations are particularly bad at \u0026ndash; we forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds.\nIf you want people to remember information, give them a document and a coffee, and time to read. Then you can answer their questions, discuss, agree on the next steps, and leave.\nThis is what happens in meetings at companies like Amazon and LinkedIn, where not only do meetings never have slides - they never have presentations. Meetings begin with a period of silence, during which participants read a document that tells them everything they need to know, and the subjects up for discussion in the meeting.\nAfter reading, everybody is literally on the same page. They ask questions, they check understanding, they discuss, they agree - and nobody gets up to present. Meetings take half as long as they did before. And anyone who missed the meeting can easily read the document to get a far better briefing than they would have got by reading a bunch of bullet points.\nPresentations are very bad at informing people - but they can be great at transforming them.\n   What is your transformational objective?\nYour aim as a presenter is to change your audience in some way. If, after your presentation, they neither believe, feel, nor do anything new or different, then you’ve wasted your time.\nWhat’s worse is that you’ve wasted theirs.\nTo work out a transformational objective, simply complete this sentence:\nAfter this presentation, my audience will _______________________.\nMake sure the verb in the last part of the sentence is a feeling or doing verb. If you find yourself with the verb “know”, ask yourself why they need to know this – and then complete the sentence again with the real objective.\nBad: “After my presentation, my audience will know our corporate presentation style.”\nGood: “After my presentation, my audience will successfully use our corporate presentation style every time.”\nRemember, if you haven’t got a clear objective, you’re certain not to achieve it.\n--For more tips on how to present successfully follow us on LinkedIn and leave a comment or question!

Guest: Phil Waknell\n   Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your regular cup of presentation inspiration.\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at why presentation should rhyme not with Information but with Transformation.\nRose: [00:00:16] So Phil, you said that presentations should rhyme with transformation instead of information. What do you mean by that?\nPhil: [00:00:23] Well, far too many presentations simply aim to inform the audience, to transfer neurons, brain cells, from the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain to the audience\u0026rsquo;s brain. And you know what? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because we don\u0026rsquo;t have perfect memories. Do you have a perfect memory?\nRose: [00:00:40] Unfortunately no.\nPhil: [00:00:41] We forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that try and remember what I said 30 seconds ago. That\u0026rsquo;s really really hard. So if you aim only to inform the audience then you\u0026rsquo;ll fail. If you want to give them information then give them a document, give them a coffee and give them some time so they can read that document. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective but a presentation is fantastic for transforming the audience.\nPhil: [00:01:07] It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic for changing something in what the audience believes, in what they feel and in what they do. So always ask yourself this question when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting: \u0026ldquo;After this presentation the audience will ____.\u0026rdquo; What? What will they believe differently, what will they feel differently, what will they do differently. And that\u0026rsquo;s your objective.\nRose: [00:01:33] I completely agree Phil and what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is that unfortunately I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been trained pretty wrong, even in our schools, when we grow up we\u0026rsquo;re taught to give information first, to value the information. But what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is we don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do that and it\u0026rsquo;s not the most effective place: in a boardroom, in a presentation. And what we can do instead is focus on making a change in what they know, what they believe, what they feel and what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do after the presentation. Is that right?\nPhil: [00:02:07] That\u0026rsquo;s absolutely right. I think the real key point is that the main subject of your presentation is not the information you have to tell them\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s the audience. It\u0026rsquo;s all about them and it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you need to transform them in order to achieve your objectives.\nPhil: [00:02:24] You may need to put some information into that presentation of course, in order to achieve those objectives, but it\u0026rsquo;s all about the transformation. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve got information that does not support your transformational objective then take it out because what you take out will actually reinforce what you leave in.\nRose: [00:02:43] So this reminds me, yesterday when I was coaching this young executive at one of the larger French companies we work with, he is working on his communication style. And when you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to an executive team you know very well you need to be brief. You need to say what needs to be said directly. Well another thing we talked about is in his presentation he will only have 20 minutes to actually motivate his team to take action on a project. This is not the time to inform them of all the bullet points that go into \u0026lsquo;why the project\u0026rsquo;, the action plan, etc. This is the time to motivate them, reassure them, make them feel confident and supported. And I saw the light bulb go on for him yesterday. And I think it can for all of us when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about how we design a presentation.\nPhil: [00:03:33] Absolutely. So always remember if your only aim is information, well cancel your presentation and give them a document and a coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective. But if you actually have an aim of transforming your audience, motivating them like with your client there or making them want to buy something or making them desire something or just making them believe something different: well, that\u0026rsquo;s your objective. Build everything around that.\nPhil: [00:03:58] And remember that what you tell them they\u0026rsquo;ll probably forget, but what they feel and what they get out of it in terms of transformation: that will last. And that\u0026rsquo;s what makes an effective presentation.\nRose: [00:04:15] Phil, now that would be a real revolution. Thank you for watching. We hope we have transformed how you think of presentations.\n[00:04:23] And we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot more to share. So, please subscribe to our YouTube channel or wherever you get your podcasts.

Ideas on Stage may not be a tech company, but we have helped thousands of start-ups with their pitches, and partner with many accelerators including Ashoka’s ShareIT.io, based at Station F. So we are very much part of the French Tech ecosystem, and very interested in how it is evolving under its new Director, our good friend Kat Borlongan. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t present for the event at Station F, you can catch the playback on Facebook LIVE here.\nIt’s no surprise to see Macron supporting tech entrepreneurs: while Economy Minister a few years back, he was regularly seen at tech events and even CES. But taking live questions, on a day when his government was under fire about the time it is taking over the cabinet reshuffle, was brave to say the least.\nMost politicians would have ensured questions were ‘planted’ in the audience, or simply gathered questions beforehand and addressed them in turn. Macron did neither. Questions were taken from a sea of raised hands by Kat Borlongan, not by Macron, and I know first-hand that those questions were chosen at random.\nI’m not going to comment on the politics or the quality of his answers. (I always try to stay out of politics.) But I will cover three important points that speakers can learn from what Macron did very well, and two more from what he could still improve.\n\n1. Improvisation requires preparation\nIf Macron was able to listen to unprepared questions and seem completely at ease responding to them – on subjects as varied as diversity, anti-trust, ed-tech, visas and even pesticides – it is because he was extremely well-briefed.\nBirds can ‘wing it’. Presenters cannot. Macron knew when taking this stage that he would have to deal with a wide variety of subjects, and at no stage did he seem lost or short of an answer, plus he did not dodge any question as politicians tend to do. Whether you agree with his policies or not, he is certainly very well-informed.\nImprovisation is hard for anyone (and impossible for some). There is a danger that presenters think that their choice is either to prepare very well, or to improvise and therefore not need to prepare. That is wrong. Macron gave a fine example of how strong preparation makes you ready to improvise.\nPreparation is always the difference between weak and strong communication. Whether you are learning a speech or preparing a Q\u0026amp;A session, Benjamin Franklin’s famous words always apply: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”\n\n2. Dare to surprise\nOne question received its own round of applause, because it resonated with so many entrepreneurs in the audience. The questioner explained that he finds it difficult to recruit employees because of the very high employers’ social charges, which mean in France that an employee costs far more than they actually take home. “My enemy is the URSSAF,” (the French Social Security agency).\nMacron took a moment to reflect on this statement and the audience’s sympathetic applause, and replied: “The URSSAF is your friend.”\n   \nIt would have been very easy to sympathize, and then to explain what his government is doing to reduce social security charges and government spending, but Macron chose a daring approach. He chose to say the opposite of what most entrepreneurs in the room believed. Immediately the audience had a tweetable, newsworthy statement, and he had everybody’s attention.\nHe then went on to defend the French social model, and the importance of social security, while later saying that they are working to lower social charges and make hiring easier. But that would not have been as powerful without his daring, controversial statement that everybody will easily remember days and weeks later.\nDare to surprise your audience. They will sit up and pay attention – and that is half the battle for any speaker.\n\n3. Smile, and the audience smiles with you\nOne improvement I have noticed in Macron’s speaking behavior over the years has been his smile. While his predecessor François Hollande strove in vain to appear presidential, and therefore always tried to seem serious and grave, Macron appears to believe in his ideas and policies, and he is now visibly positive when he explains them.\nSmiling is important for two reasons. First, when we smile, the audience can hear it. Our words sound more positive, more engaging, and less boring. Try this on the phone, or try to listen on your next call. You can tell whether your correspondent is smiling.\nThe second reason is that we all have mirror neurons which unconsciously perceive and reproduce the emotions we perceive in others. If you see a speaker who appears negative, demotivated, or even bored, then you will experience the same feelings. If however you see a speaker who is positive, who speaks with passion, who clearly believes what she is saying, then you will feel the same way.\nMacron appeared to enjoy the exchange yesterday. He seemed positive in explaining his policies. That made it so much easier for the audience to feel equally positive.\n\nSo those are three important lessons any speaker can learn from President Macron’s exchange yesterday. Here are two more speaking tips, which Macron can still improve on, and which we can all benefit from employing more.\n\n4. Short answers are best\nIn a session where there are potentially hundreds of questions, answering only a handful of them will leave many people disappointed, and many subjects uncovered. This may be easier for the speaker, but it is not better for the audience. While Macron’s initial speech was refreshingly short, his answers to most of the questions were very long. Although he tried to make it up by staying longer than planned and taking four questions at the end when Kat had said there was time for only one, it would have been a far more dynamic, interesting and fruitful exchange if he had taken twice as many questions, and answered each one in half the time.\nWhy? The danger when you give a long answer is that people forget the question, or they forget the beginning of your answer when you get to the end. It is also usually true that much of the audience has no interest in the answer to some questions, therefore it is wise not to take too long unless the answer is of clear interest to everybody. For example, the first question yesterday was about EdTech which is an important niche but a niche nonetheless, and after several minutes, anyone not in that niche was left wondering when Macron would finish and move on to a subject they might care about.\nAim to keep any answer to no more than two minutes. When you set yourself this limit, you will be amazed at what you can say in those two minutes, and it will be more powerful than a comprehensive 5-minute answer.\n\n5. Finish with a flourish\nMany speakers fail to pay attention to the end of their speech, or the end of their sentences. Yesterday, Macron was able to speak clearly and coherently for minutes on end, but then once he would start to wrap-up his answers, he appeared to run out of words, or out of breath, and tail off. Twice the audience though he had finished, and applauded when in fact he had not properly completed his sentence. On several other occasions, it was clear he was already thinking of the next sentence, and lost power at the end of the current sentence in his haste to begin the next. This is one of the most common problems I encounter when helping speakers.\nSadly this lackluster finish also happened right at the very end of the evening when Macron gave a call to action to the entrepreneurs in the room. This was an excellent way to finish, but unfortunately the last sentence tailed off, and ended up with slightly awkward applause punctuated by a slightly embarrassed “Voilà” from the President.\n\nThink of a sentence like a two-headed match. It should begin powerfully, like striking the head of a match causing it to burst into flame. Then, keep your message burning, ensuring nobody switches off. And finally, at the end, when a typical match or dull statement would normally sizzle out into silence, suddenly and surprisingly, it reignites in flame!\n(This analogy also goes for any presentation. Start strong, and finish with a flourish.)\nMacron could benefit from practicing conclusions. And any speaker can gain power and credibility by ensuring they finish each sentence – especially the final one – clearly and powerfully. Even when improvising. And if you have prepared well, you will likely have already generated several possible conclusions you can use that will ensure a big round of applause.\n\nPresident Macron is a powerful, confident communicator. And even though he is already a highly skilled speaker, he is not yet the finished article, and he continues to improve. That in itself should be a lesson to us all: every speaker, no matter how good, has potential to further develop and stretch their skills. It comes through practice, a desire to improve, and through a deep respect for your audience that drives you to give them the best experience possible.\nMacron gave French Tech a great experience yesterday. I have no doubt he’ll be even better next time.\nPhotos © Ideas on Stage 2018\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"2422ba353fc44ac63a35ceec4a5ef83d","tags":["Speaking","Lessons","President","French","Macron","Talk","Technique","Tips","Learning","Present","Tech","Station F","Paris","Politics",""],"title":"5 Speaking Lessons from President Macron","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/10/10/2018-10-10-5-speaking-lessons-from-president-macron/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["speaking; event design; presentation; coaching; montage; video; promo"],"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s already October and you know what that means\u0026hellip; Firming up plans for next year.

Participants in Vancouver will be treated to high-quality talks from well-prepared speakers, and will leave feeling energized and inspired.\nBack in the office, you and your colleagues will no doubt be subjected to low-quality presentations from poorly-prepared speakers, and you will leave feeling bored and uninspired.\nBusiness presentations are not TED talks. A board meeting is not a stage with a round red carpet. Yet businesses can and should learn a few vital lessons from TED, and apply them to their own presentations.\nWhat makes TED talks different from most business presentations? Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on three key factors.\n**1. Short talks are better **\nOne of the key rules at TED is that no presentation can last more than 18 minutes, no matter who is speaking. Businesses should take note. We always used to ask ourselves the question: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation long enough to tell them everything I want to say?\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact a better question would be: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation short enough to keep their attention and ensure they remember my key messages?\u0026rdquo;\nAttention spans are short, and in an oral presentation people forget most of what they hear within 30 seconds, so the more you say, the less they remember of it. Better to say little, but to say it effectively. Remember the words of Baltasar Gracián: \u0026ldquo;Good things, when short, are twice as good.\u0026rdquo;\n**2. Slides are visual aids, not cheat-sheets or handouts **\nMany TED talks do not use any slides. They are not always necessary, and many business presentations do not need them either. Frankly, any business presentation would be more effective with no slides than with bad, text-heavy slides that actually stop the audience from listening to the speaker. People simply cannot read and listen at the same time, so the more text you put on your slide, the less you are communicating.\nTED speakers do not use slides as their cheat-sheets: slides, where they are used, are visual aids to help the audience to understand and remember their key messages. Business presenters should use them in the same way. If you need a cheat-sheet or notes to remember the flow of your presentation, that\u0026rsquo;s fine: keep it on a card or piece of paper in front of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t project it behind you. If you need to distribute information so your audience has a record of what you said, give them a short standalone document that summarizes your key messages, but don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that your slides will do that job. If they are good visual aids, they will not be a good handout.\nUse slides only where needed, and make sure they follow the 5-second rule: every time you click, the audience should be able to \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; the new content in under 5 seconds. Otherwise they will stop listening to you, and the communication will be broken.\n**3. Preparation is the key to success **\nEvery TED speaker prepares their talk over a period of several months, with the help of professional presentation coaches. At Ideas on Stage, we\u0026rsquo;ve helped many hundreds of TED and TEDx speakers to imagine and create a fascinating talk, to illustrate it with breathtaking visual aids, and to prepare mentally and physically to take the stage and speak convincingly to their audience. Preparation is the key to success.\nFor most business presentations, you won\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of spending months fine-tuning your talk with specialist help. You have limited time and need to spend it wisely. But you can still prepare well, and your audience deserves a well-prepared presentation.\nIf your time is limited, don\u0026rsquo;t waste it all producing slides. Slides are always optional, sometimes nice-to-have, but never necessary - especially if you are anyway giving your audience a short hand-out. Rehearsal, however, is required. If your presentation lasts 18 minutes - and ideally it should not be much longer - then it only takes an hour to rehearse it three times. The fourth time will be far more convincing than the first.\nSo if you have limited time, skip the slides but take an hour to rehearse. It will be time well-spent and your presentation will be far more powerful as a result.\nSummary\nBusiness can learn many lessons from the success of TED, starting with these three:\n Short talks are better: don\u0026rsquo;t say too much, but say it effectively Slides are visual aids: don\u0026rsquo;t use them as cheat-sheets or handouts Preparation is the key to success: take the time to prepare and rehearse  There are many more: for example, your introduction should create an emotional reaction that makes the audience want to listen; and we remember information far better when it\u0026rsquo;s told in the form of a story or example. Those rules are just as applicable in business.\nIf you apply these lessons to your next business presentation, the result might not look like a TED talk, but it will have a much better chance of energizing and inspiring its participants than a poorly-prepared speaker muddling through a bunch of boring bullet-points.\nYour audiences deserve successful presentations, and your business depends on them.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about TEDifying your business presentations, contact us at info@ideasonstage.com or fill in the form below and we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you quickly.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"38de4b73d8f50ae01a752df6e666b2cc","tags":["TED","TEDx","business presentation","tips"],"title":"What Business Can Learn From TED","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/04/10/2018-04-10-what-business-can-learn-from-ted/"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","categories":["stage fright","presenting","fear"],"content":" Fear doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove the danger. Embrace it and get on top of your presentations.\n \u0026ldquo;There is nothing to fear but fear itself\u0026rdquo; - a memorable line from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026rsquo;s inaugural address in 1932 at the depths of the Great Depression. At the time he may not have realized it, but his words are among the most powerful pieces of advice for public speaking.\nAfter all, what we all fear in presentations is succumbing to fear. Losing our cool, forgetting what needs to be said, not convincing the audience enough. Failing in front of our peers. Doubt, doubt and more doubt.\nBut fear is often generated and worsened by inaction. How many of us do not act when faced by our fears? Fear is a mechanism of the mind to forewarn us, an alarm that lets us know that danger lies ahead and we should do something about it before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nThe science behind fear is well-documented. Many of us have heard of the \u0026ldquo;fight or flight\u0026rdquo; instinct. For a speaker, these two extreme actions are manifested by the loss of presence from either shrinking and hiding from an audience (\u0026ldquo;flight\u0026rdquo;) or coming out swinging or trying to control them (\u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo;). The third extreme reaction is to \u0026ldquo;freeze\u0026rdquo; - the presentation equivalent of \u0026ldquo;playing dead\u0026rdquo;.\nThe natural balance where you can make a true connection with an audience comes from confidence and relaxation. Some of us are better equipped to deal with fear, while some of us are not stable enough to manage it well. We can all benefit, though, from reducing unnecessary sources of fear that cause stress we can do without.\nThe following 7 steps may not be a cure for everyone, particularly those with deep fears linked to public speaking, but they are a very good start.\n1. Master your content - don\u0026rsquo;t let it master you.\nThere are often parts of a presentation where the speaker does not entirely master what he or she is talking about. These knowledge gaps can be stressful, and trying to explain something that you have not fully mastered will bring a negative feedback loop from the audience as they struggle to understand. Present only what you master, and master everything you present.\n2. Rehearse aloud in advance with your slides and timer.\nRehearsing aloud is the best thing any speaker can do, but also the rarest. We can spend hours tweaking messages or putting polish on slides, but never enough time on our feet rehearsing. Use a timer so you know exactly how long your presentation takes, and ensure you only take 90% of your allotted time so that on the day you are not stressed about overrunning.\n3. Connect with your audience.\nIf you can meet members of the audience prior to a presentation, this can be hugely beneficial. You must not think like an actor waiting in the wings until the curtain rises. This makes the task harder. Knowing at least some of your audience, and knowing they are not dragons, will reduce your fear and stress.\n4. Check that everything works.\nTechnical problems can disrupt a presentation, but even if it all ends up running smoothly, the fear of technical problems can be very destabilizing for a presenter. Many presentations have sunk due to last minute problems with slides, compatibility issues (software and hardware), fonts not downloaded, resolution issues, not having the right adaptor, etc. Solution? Get there early and take the time to ensure all slides and videos look good in real conditions - on the actual computer and actual screen - and you will save yourself a lot of worry, and reduce your stress levels. You should also find the technician in charge of the room. They are your best friend. I once had a technician who saved me from a crashed and locked computer during a presentation in front of a dozen Chinese fashion executives.\n5. Trust yourself.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t rehearse your presentation 101 times. Trust your subconscious mind and leave a little margin for the unknown. You\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it more.\n6. Avoid coffee.\nThis should be obvious but many speakers don\u0026rsquo;t realize how important it is. Don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee before presenting, especially if you know you are sensitive to it. Caffeine not only increases your stress levels: it also dries out your mouth and throat, so your voice is less resonant and less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ve trained coffee companies and they know this - so should you!\n7. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of being afraid.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m back to the original quotation. If you accept that everyone feels fear when they take the stage, even the greatest speakers, then you can also accept that stress is the body\u0026rsquo;s way of preparing you to perform at your best.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate all stress when presenting, and you would perform worse if you did. These tips will help you to remove unnecessary stress, leaving you with just enough so you can master it, and use it to deliver your best.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f5cb107fbd20923a59f922a84ee39867","tags":["stage fright","presenting","fear"],"title":"7 Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Presenting","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/04/09/2018-04-10-7-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-presenting/"},{"author":"Marion Chapsal","categories":["News","Presentations","Tips"],"content":" Have you seen Gary Oldman in his interpretation of Churchill in the latest biopic by Joe Wright? If you have not, please go. It’s jaw-dropping. His outstanding performance may very soon win him an Oscar. You will enjoy some of the finest acting and also benefit from precious presentation lessons from the Master Orator.\nHere are 3 takeaways from the movie, which you can immediately apply for your next keynote, sales meeting or investor pitch.\n\n1. Sit down and listen. \n  © Working Title Films—@Working_Title\n \nIn one scene, likely fictional according to the critics, Churchill decides to go and meet the people.\nHe takes his first-ever ride on a London Underground train, and begins asking random citizens if they would fight the Nazis even if the odds were stacked against them? They reply in one clear, loud and vibrant voice: “Never surrender!”\nThere and then, Churchill’s decision to refuse peace talks with Hitler is strengthened. He rushes to deliver what will become one of his most powerful speeches, taking into account these citizens’ words, quoting them and even crediting them by name.\nI loved this scene and frankly do not care whether it happened or not. In fact, it resembles the coaching advice I recently gave to the Senior Manager of an international company during one of our first sessions. As we explored the context of his annual strategy presentation, using Ideas on Stage methodologies like the ABCs (Audience, Burning Needs, Context), I gently guided him through a series of discovery questions. He soon realized he had only the vaguest sense of his audience: what was their experience? What did they most want and need from him in his speech?\n“Why don’t you learn directly from your people?” I offered. Ask them. Wait. Listen quietly. Put yourself in their shoes. Thank them. And then reflect back.\nSo, during the Christmas holidays, he collected feedback and stories from his teams across Europe. In his talk, delivered before several hundred sales managers, he incorporated several personal stories that made the difference. “Wendy from the UK told me…, Karl from Germany…, etc.” He truly connected with his audience and showed them he cared.\n\u0026ldquo;Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”—Winston Churchill\n\n2. Prepare to sweat. Maybe not blood and tears, but certainly sweat. In this movie, we see once again how Churchill literally perspires over the writing of his speeches. Even to the point of “steaming”. Just like Steve Jobs, Churchill was not a “born speaker”. And we believe no-one is.\nHe drafted his speeches many times over, until the very last moment. He dictated them to a secretary. Perhaps today he would use his iPhone to record himself and save some poor girl’s nerves. He then rehearsed passages, again and again, pacing up and down his room, repeating them aloud, learning whole speeches by heart.\nAs we coach CEOs, start-up entrepreneurs, doctors and TEDx speakers, we are often asked: “How long will the preparation last? How many sessions will it take?” The answer: it all depends on how dedicated you are to the task and its success. How much are you willing to invest in your success? It takes true dedication and involves many hours of lonely drafting, stumbling over words, pausing and rewriting. And then again, iterations with visuals. And rehearsals. Out loud. Again and again.\nIt’s a performance. It involves your whole brain, your whole body. Your full presence. That’s why leaders seek out seasoned presentation coaches for this delicate mental, emotional and physical preparation.\n\n3. Embrace imperfection and fear. Churchill wasn’t born a master orator—he overcame a childhood lisp by painstakingly practicing enunciation. He also always took his notes with him and would sometimes appear to stumble or hesitate, all in order to make a calculated effect.\nHe knew that a speech which is too perfect, with almost robotic delivery, would put people to sleep. He knew that the more conversational and simple a speech sounded, the more tuned in his audience would be. There is a very touching scene when King George VI asks Churchill if he is afraid. “I am most terribly. Terribly afraid,” admits Churchill.\nDuring our coaching sessions and workshops, we pay attention to vulnerability. We don’t aim at perfection; we aim rather to bring out your authentic best. In the intimate space of trust and acceptance created between the coach and the speaker, fear is invited, politely. And then just as politely, we make sure she keeps quiet. This way we free up the space to hear the voice of passion, care, enthusiasm.\nSpeaking in public doesn’t require you to be fearless. It requires you to speak through the fear.\n\nCall to Action: Next time you find yourself getting prepared to give a presentation, remember these 3 simple tips from The Darkest Hour and prepare to give your finest talk yet:\n− Be brave enough to listen to your audience—and if you have no idea what they are thinking, feeling, believing or doing, find out!\n− Spend the time to write and craft your messages, and practice them aloud. Then review, edit and iterate.\n− If you feel the shadows of fear—inner critics, voices of comparison, or even shame—begin by acknowledging the feeling. It’s OK: you are human. Then come back to your passion, your purpose for presenting, and move forward.\nDo not attempt to be perfect or fearless. Dare to prepare, and dare to present.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"7ad8dc5b94d78243b3e8e48eda68498b","tags":["News","Presentations","Tips"],"title":"3 presentation lessons from The Darkest Hour","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/02/16/2018-02-16-the-darkest-hour-presentation-lessons/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Design","Brand"],"content":"I am not a naive man.

In the end we decided we wanted to keep a link with our beginnings, and at the same time add subtle clues about who we are. The new logo has three circles. The big orange one represents the presence of the Speaker on stage. The small white circle is the head of the Speaker, the dot on the i of ideas, and the inner circle. The small orange circle breaks with the mold; it’s the outer circle, the one where the Speaker moves forward and connects with the audience.\nAfter working on the font and logo, I still had time to write a letter to Santa. But instead we chose to spend time on refreshing the look of our website, to our new visual identity. We simplified the navigation and made it more visual.\nBy then it was early January and too late to write my letter to Santa. I don’t believe in him but I hope he hasn’t blacklisted me for next year.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"219f72c5efca3d4d404a044bbf6fe29f","tags":["Design","Brand"],"title":"New brand, new design","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/01/26/2018-01-26-new-brand-new-design/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["France","TEDx","Event"],"content":" For the third year running, Ideas on Stage was very happy to partner with the TEDx Saclay conference, which took place this November 30, 2017 in the brand-new CentraleSupélec amphitheater at the Plateau de Saclay on the powerful theme of “Serving the Living”.\nTEDx Saclay Keeping standards typically high, this year’s event boasted a rich program of speakers including a few notably prestigious guests such as Cédric Villani \u0026ndash; renowned mathematician and member of the French National Assembly \u0026ndash; as well as artists, scientists, students, entrepreneurs and even a Guinness World Record gamer (Kayane).

From Friday September 29th through Sunday evening on the 1st of October, Marion Chapsal and her co-facilitator Evelyn McKelvie will guide eight willing and ready women on a journey to find \u0026ndash; or fine-tune \u0026ndash; their public voice and take the stage alongside, you guessed it, horses. They call this workshop and retreat \u0026ldquo;The Heroine\u0026rsquo;s Journey\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Evelyn’s June article on “Slaying the Dragon of Fear”, it’s clear that she and Marion share a synergy in their coaching mission even though they come from opposite ends of the pond, as in Canada and France.\nExcuse me? Let me back up. Like Marion, Evelyn is a longtime Leadership Coach, working with Corporate Executives mainly through facilitating retreats. However, she is also the Founder of Equine Coach, an organization which “focuses on leadership development, mindfulness, and enhanced communication skills through working and playing with horses”.\nShe sees how spending hands-on time with horses is a transformational learning opportunity that connects people back to nature and their own intuitive emotional intelligence.\nIn Evelyn’s words: “Whether or not you are a corporate leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, an aspiring politician or activist, or a mom who wants to be a role model for her daughter”, being comfortable speaking with a microphone, being filmed or taking the stage in any way is key to building and flourishing in a career.\nMarion Chapsal, Chief Learning Officer and creator of Women on Stage, is also fully aware of this truth. Why? Because having worked with countless professionals including young female entrepreneurs to global political leaders, her life’s work is dedicated in many ways to nourishing and reinforcing women’s power and presence in their life and work, on or off-stage.\nWhen answering the question “Why women only workshops?” Marion answers:\n Women really get to speak! They\u0026rsquo;re less likely to be interrupted, and if they are, they will not remain silent as they might when interrupted by a man.\n Women more easily overcome their self-censorship in a safe environment of their female peers, which enables a sense of trust and transparency.\n Women have the space to identify specific issues and personal/professional needs.\n Women develop a collaborative conversation and weave a support network.\n  She goes on to share that “as a result, once we [women] have addressed the psycho-sociological factors and established trust and belonging, with a bit of technique and ongoing practice and growing awareness, every woman can cultivate a voice that’s strong, clear, resonant and effective.” Marion goes deeper on the subject of gender-balanced leadership in her talk at TEDxStuttgart, using the age-old story of Goldilocks in a less traditional way.\nSo, we see there is an important alchemy in women-only spaces, like The Heroine’s Journey, for their ability to maximize individual transformation through gender-common group intention and action. That said, this newly generated energy and confidence must certainly not stay limited to the space between women.\nLike a roaring fire starts at the level of an ember, tended by a gentle and consistent source of air, female leadership can be sparked among female peers but must grow to illuminate all in a mix of environments and audiences.\nSo how did two women with rather unique coaching backgrounds decide to blend their passion and expertise in a three-day workshop?\n“When I first met Marion early in 2016 we talked for hours about our passions and strengths in the work we do. I knew Marion had a unique and powerful model that helps women cross that threshold and take centre stage with comfort. Our overlapping areas of interest around Presence meant that soon we were planning a joint retreat that exploits the power of our two modalities - being on the stage and being in the round pen.” Words by Evelyn McKelvie.\nI hear there are still a few places left. So, if this calls to you, or makes you think of a friend, manager or colleague who would benefit, you can find details and registration here. And, with TED 2018 in Vancouver coming up, I can just imagine the presentations brewing or in brainstorm phase that would flourish in this type of workshop.\n\"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman.\" - Melinda Gates.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"22434ca2b6eb9b8c647a1e6df7d0f43c","tags":["Women","Event","Retreat","Training","Canada"],"title":"Taking Female Leadership by the Reins","type":"news","url":"/news/2017/09/04/2017-09-04-taking-female-leadership-by-the-reins/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["Women","Entrepreneur","Event","Pitch","Paris"],"content":"It’s a simple fact that most successful startups are run by men. Why? Firstly, there are more men than women who decide - or dare - to start companies. Secondly, men are more successful at raising funds than women, and even those women who do raise funds end up raising less, on average, than their male counterparts. Having spent two years playing in the Silicon Valley arena myself, I’ve seen this truth first hand both in California and now in France. It’s a sad state of affairs, and it needs to change.\nEvents like Be a boss, happening this September 21st in Paris, aim to encourage women to start and run their own companies, and help them to succeed. At Ideas on Stage, we care deeply about redressing the gender balance, ensuring women have every opportunity to build their careers, and helping them to make and take these opportunities with both hands.\nSo, we’re very happy that for the third year running, Phil Waknell, our Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage, has been invited to deliver two keynotes at Be a boss, aiming to inspire the many female entrepreneurs to pitch themselves and their companies brilliantly, and help them to raise funds and attract clients. Given his experience helping literally hundreds of start-ups prepare and deliver powerful pitches that win contests and raise millions, I asked Phil about his thoughts on the matter.\n“Many of the best pitchers I’ve seen are women,” says Phil, who believes that in fact women have many advantages over men when it comes to pitching. “I find women generally spend more time preparing and thinking about what their audience needs, and more time rehearsing, whereas too many men have a tendency to ‘wing it’ and lean on their skills and charisma. That puts women at a great advantage, because preparation is the most important key to pitch success”.\nSo why do women raise funds less often than men? “Partly it’s because the investment community is still very male-dominated,” explains Phil, “and consciously or subconsciously that leads them to invest more easily in men. Plus, it’s a unfortunate fact of life that any minority needs to reach higher standards just to get an even chance, and among startup entrepreneurs women are still a very small minority. This is changing but there’s a long way to go, so women need to pitch at least as well as men, and ideally even better.”\nSo why is it that those women who make it over this barrier and convince investors still end up raising lower amounts than men? “I’ve heard this explained simply: women ask for less capital. Is this because of lower ambitions, lower expectations or lower self-confidence? I think they all play a part.”\nThat said, what does this mean for women looking to raise funds? “Like so much in life, it comes down to skills and attitude,” says Phil. “Learning how to create and deliver a fantastic pitch is vital for any entrepreneur, and building those skills will help women to build their self-confidence. As long as your startup is worth investing in and your business plan is credible, a powerful pitch delivered with a confident, positive attitude and a strong ambition will hook investors. And I truly believe that with this kind of pitch and attitude, a woman has a better chance of standing out than a man.”\nTo see Phil’s keynote and many other great speakers, sign up for Be a boss here - note that the event will be in French.\nIf you can’t make it to Be a boss, or you don’t speak French, why not sign up for our women-only course Women on Stage, led by Marion Chapsal, one of Europe’s leading specialists in gender-balanced leadership and coach to many top female executives. She is also leading a power-packed women’s retreat and training, The Heroine’s Journey, this September 29-October 1 in beautiful British Columbia to empower women to find their voice and take the stage.\nBe a boss 2017 - links and information Event program: http://www.be-a-boss.com/programme-complet\nRegistration for Be a boss: http://www.be-a-boss.com/inscriptions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Beaboss2017/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Beaboss2017\nPrior to founding Ideas on Stage in 2010, Phil was manager at Procter \u0026amp; Gamble and commercial director at Hewlett-Packard. Today, apart from his many creative assignments with large corporate clients, Phil teaches at HEC Paris, and regularly speaks in public about the need to communicate differently.

This year’s theme? “Lost in Transition: the time of possibilities”.\nThis annual event is dedicated to exploring the skills and solutions necessary to live well in our emerging digital age across all sectors, from sustainable energy to food and agriculture.\nParticipants came from all around France including officials of state to leaders from top corporations to present on the latest products, research and methodology, as well as to continue forging the connections needed across industries to achieve meaningful and global results.\nBuilding on the first day of sharing information and inspiration, they dedicated a second day on Tuesday the 29th to bring a smaller fraction of the group together for a day of workshops. The mission? To walk away with shareable resources and potential solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our world today—or is it already “tomorrow”?\n  Roundtable, Day 1 - Photo by Charles-Marie Boret‏ @cmboret Aug 28\n  As most of the Ideas on Stage team was away on vacation for some part of August, I had the luck of stepping into this project as one of my very first with the company. It was a privilege getting to work with the event’s Master of Ceremonies (MC), Alain Chauveau, as well as with four of the ten “TED style” expert presenters to support them in clarifying their core messages and structuring a 15-minute presentation that would leave the audience motivated and empowered.\nAmong the group were presenters Bruno Teboul, SVP Science \u0026amp; Innovation at Keyrus and author of Robotariat, Stéphan Aver, founder of Aaqius creators of the consumer-safe hydrogen canister STOR-H, Guillaume Marolleau, Head of Digital and Consumer Experience at Fleury Michon, and Joël Ruet, Chairman of The Bridge Tank.\nIt’s not the easiest for French professionals at this level to meet in August when most of France is on vacation, but each presenter made the time\u0026ndash;even if it meant taking a skype coaching call at midnight after a dinner in China just days before the event.\n  Brainstorming, Day 2 - Photo by Troisième Voix @3voixcom Aug 29\n  Now two months into working at Ideas on Stage, what stands out most is the level of quality, intelligence and heart of the organizations and individuals we get to interface with, including our team internally. An event like ACIDD is a perfect example of one such group of dedicated individuals who come together with a mission to send ripples of good out into the world, shaping our collective future toward global sustainability and well-being.\nTo learn more about the L’Université D’Été ACIDD and future events, head over to their official site or follow them on Facebook and Twitter @UECDD.

For thousands of years, many of the most talented speakers could be found not in a shop or office but in a place of worship.\nAsk people which public speaker they most admire, and many will point to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. He spoke powerfully and inspired his audiences, and of the well-known speakers of the last century he was certainly among the best. Yet go to many Southern Baptist churches and you will find unknown preachers who speak with a similar style and no less power.\nReligion today in many Western communities in particular is facing a decline in congregations and a loss of interest among the young. It is all the more important for the heads of those congregations to be able to speak powerfully, to inspire their followers, and not only keep them coming back but to get them to bring their families and friends.\nTo be blunt, presentation skills are of the utmost importance for preachers, yet they are not always taught how to write or deliver a good sermon.\nThe Diocese of Toulouse, in the south of France, has decided it’s time to invest in their preachers’ presentation skills, so this October, Ideas on Stage will distill all of its expertise in storytelling, oratory and inspiration and take it to Toulouse for a workshop that promises to be very different from our usual sessions with startups, TED speakers and business executives, but just as important and impactful.\nSo, who teaches the preachers?
