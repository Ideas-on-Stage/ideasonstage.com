It’s rarely the best-known speakers who deliver the stand-out talks: it’s the best-prepared speakers.\nThis is where Ideas on Stage comes in. Since we assisted photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand with his memorable TED talk in 2009, we have helped over 300 TEDx speakers to create, prepare and deliver the talks of their lives. Curators across the world – from Montreal to Paris, from London to Washington DC – have trusted our professional storytelling experts, speaker coaches and designers to get the best out of their speakers.\nWhile most of our work is with major international corporations, helping senior executives with their most important presentations, our approach is to apply lessons from TED to the business world, rather than to apply business speaking basics to TED. So we’re not just your usual humdrum speaker coaches: we live and breathe TED every day, whether we’re working on a luxury product launch, a startup pitch or a TEDx talk.\nAnd since we love working with TEDx speakers and helping them spread their ideas, we do it for free - and in return we ask only to be listed with your other TEDx sponsors/partners. Of course our TEDx offers are subject to availability – it wouldn’t help you or anyone else if we tried to work on ten TEDx-es at once – but we usually find a way to help out if you give us enough advance notice.\nHere are the three levels of what we offer, starting with our free offer, and working all the way up to the full package which isn’t free, but offers a far greater contribution to your event.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b092db44cd25bd5fe9cc92d77584dce6","tags":null,"title":"TEDx Coaching","type":"tedx","url":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Train your teams to give TED-quality business presentations Presentations are everywhere in business, and most of them fail to reach their objectives - if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.\nThe Business Presentation Revolution, accompanied by the book of the same name, is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method. This course is taught in leading companies and forms part of the HEC Paris Executive MBA curriculum.\nThe course follows the four key steps of the Presentation SCORE method:\n Preparation - understanding your audience and their needs, setting your objective, and brainstorming to find your key messages Storytelling - shaping your messages into a compelling storyline that grabs and keeps the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and makes your key messages stick Visual Design - illustrating your talk with powerful visual aids that help your audience to understand and remember, instead of the typical death-by-bullet-point that only makes them switch off Speaking - preparing to speak, rehearsing, and delivering your presentation comfortably and convincingly.  The Business Presentation Revolution can be configured to meet your team\u0026rsquo;s needs, from a half-day introduction all the way up to the full three-day course where every participant prepares and delivers their own presentation and receives individual advice on how to improve even further. The longer the course, the more hands-on it will be.\nMany companies choose to combine The Business Presentation Revolution with some Public Speaking Coaching, giving each participant a few hours of one-on-one coaching after the course to help them apply and perfect the new methods.\nTo find out more about The Business Presentation Revolution and how it can help your teams to present more effectively, please fill in our contact form below.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"43f90f8645f23a679d37a780e3bd1896","tags":null,"title":"The Business Presentation Revolution Training","type":"training-workshops","url":"/training-workshops/business-presentation-revolution/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator.

Your document or presentation was received, but will it be read? Will it be remembered? And most importantly, will it be acted upon? Or, did you just waste your time \u0026hellip;\nEach year companies create millions of presentations and documents. Yet most of them are boring, hard to understand and lack a clear purpose. The information is there, but it doesn’t stick; and so, it is quickly forgotten.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Presentations and documents can be engaging, clear, and to the point. They are not doomed to slowly collect dust in the bottom of the receiver’s inbox. And because your competitors’ presentations are likely to be unappealing, it’s easy to get noticed! How? By combining reason and emotion.\nMaking the receiver hear your message is not enough. You have to catch their interest to make them want to listen. To achieve this, we will first arouse their natural curiosity. Once hooked, we’ll tell a story that speaks to them and their needs, reassures them and makes them want to buy, or act on your message.\nWe rely on a stable team of writers with years of experience delivering storytelling and copywriting for some of the best companies in the world. We can make the most technical subject interesting. In fact, we’ve done just that for a wide range of industries, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetics, finance, and heavy industries.\nTo deliver great stories consistently we use tools exclusive to Ideas on Stage, such as the Audience Transformation Roadmap.

Women, when they are speaking at the workplace, almost never get it “Just Right”. Some have advised women to be more assertive and to take on masculine attitudes. Others have suggested they should stick with their roles and act their more feminine attributes. In both cases, it doesn’t work. To quote the famous leading organization Catalyst for women and business, “women are damned if they do, doomed if they don’t”. This double-bind that women face every day has created a search for a way-out, a solution.\nWomen are still culturally trained to look for perfection, to seek for approval and acceptance, to ask permission to express themselves, to avoid failure at all costs, and to feel shame to go out and show how ambitious they can be. We are still very dependant on \u0026ldquo;what will people think of me ?\u0026rdquo; and we would do anything to avoid shame, criticism and judgement.\nIn Women on Stage we’ll explore a way to be heard, taken seriously, and given the authority to make change we so clearly see, without giving up on our femininity, and allowing us to express all the nuances of our emotions, personality and intelligence.\nDiscover the power of PRESENCE and develop your unique presence on stage. Here and NOW. Neither feminine, nor masculine, but integrating your whole self, mind, body and heart.\nThis workshop is for you if…  You are a woman leader in any industry, a woman entrepreneur or a senior executive woman taking on roles with increased visibility You are required to make impactful presentations, but you do not feel entirely confident, no matter what others tell you and how experienced you can appear to be You are a high-achiever but you struggle with perfectionism and you are familiar with the imposter syndrome You sometimes feel that when you start to speak, you are interrupted or shot down before finishing your pitch You feel you need to be cautious about expressing your ideas, walking a tightrope You stay quiet during meetings for fear of being judged too aggressive or because your voice sounds too soft You would like to be perceived differently than related to your gender, but feel caught up in the double-bind You believe that improving your presentation skills will advance your leadership influence but you want to do this in a safe, supportive and entertaining environment  Key takeaways  Understand the double-bind effect for women when they communicate at work and get away from this polarity Discover the ten most common traps women fall into when they speak in public Explore what to do instead and discover the power of presence in delivery, via breathing, voice and posture techniques Learn how to deal with stage fright and embrace your fears Get the recognition you deserve with increased visibility and impact Get support and nourishment within a circle of women committed to their personal and professional growth Learn how to pick up your own style of communication, “made to mesure” that fits YOU and only you Bring your best self centre-stage  Learning Methods This is not going to be your traditional corporate training, so be prepared to work and play on the edge. We will talk and reflect, but also play, improvise, draw, relax and create. Bonus: you will be introduced to Marion’s innovative and fun 3 D coaching method, playing with archetypes.\nOne week prior to the workshop you will receive a questionnaire about your specific speaking challenges and your expectations for this workshop. You will also be asked to prepare a specific assignment, according to your profile and challenges.\nFacilitator Marion Chapsal, Ideas on Stage Chief Learning Officer\nMarion’s relentless quest is to coach women to find their voice, communicate with confidence and enthusiasm, and develop fully as 21st century women leaders. She has created Women on Stage because she believes that, still today, women’s voices are not fully heard, much less appreciated and acted upon and need more than ever to be taken into account and to have an impact to make the world a better place for all men and women.\nIn her unique coaching approach, Marion taps into theater techniques and gently encourages role playing, creating a safe and respectful environment where each participant feels free to express feelings, ideas, intuitions, take risks and pretend to be the change they want to see.\nMarion brings with her more than twenty years of executive training and coaching in Leadership and communication. She has taught Leadership at EM Lyon Business School and Cranfield School of Management. She’s a certified Master NLP coach, a rebirther and trained in Drama School and theater techniques. At 50, she went back to University to study a Master in Gender Studies, Sociology \u0026amp; linguistics, focusing on gender, speaking and power. It could have ended in a PhD; instead, she created Women on Stage.\n…and she also brings her huge collection of Comic Strips, animated movies and fairy tales characters, representing a very wide range of role-models and archetypes. The use of figurines is fantastic because it’s so easy, simple and fun!\nMarion is here to help women overcome their reluctance to shine in their lives and work, and recognize how incredibly brave and powerful they already are.\nTo organize a Women on Stage workshop for your company, or if you\u0026rsquo;d like to attend one of our public workshops, please contact us using the form below.

Founders often consider that since they know everything about their startup, they can pitch it without much effort. Yet those who succeed are those who work on their pitch, who make sure they stand out from all the other entrepreneurs, and create a lasting impression. When you meet that investor in an elevator or have to sell your product while commuting, you have one chance to succeed - so you\u0026rsquo;d better be prepared.\nIdeas on Stage helps clients create all types of pitch - from elevator pitches to investor pitches, product or even media pitches depending on their needs.

Take just five minutes to learn about the simple change that will put the horse before the cart, and you in the driver’s seat. Join Rose as she discusses a foolproof process to prepare a presentation with Phil Waknell, Co-Founder and Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage.\n   Episode 4 “Carts and Horses” Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your quick coffee break to learn how to shake up and wake up your presentations. [00:00:06][5.8]\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at one of the smallest but most important changes you can make to make a huge difference in your presentations. And it\u0026rsquo;s all about putting “the horse” before “the cart”. [00:00:16][9.5]\nRose: [00:00:20] You just mentioned “carts” and “horses”: what does that have to do with presentations? [00:00:24][3.4]\nPhil: [00:00:25] Well Rose, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard the expression \u0026lsquo;putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;, which is generally something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. But that\u0026rsquo;s what we do all the time when we\u0026rsquo;re preparing presentations. The typical way to prepare a business presentation is: *\u0026ldquo;Oh no, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do a presentation. Tomorrow. And it\u0026rsquo;s 11:30 at night. OK, so I am going to open my computer. I am going to type my PowerPoint slides and 50 slides later, I then think, OK, maybe I need some extra sub-bullets or whatever.\u0026rdquo;* And then what happens is the next day you get into the meeting room, you say hi to everybody, you connect your computer, you start showing your slides, you turn your back on the audience, you read your bullet points, and then you improvise because you haven\u0026rsquo;t prepared what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say. You end up with a whole lot of information and it\u0026rsquo;s boring as hell for the participants. I mean, how do you feel when you\u0026rsquo;re in that audience? [00:01:15][50.3]\nRose: [00:01:17] Well, unfortunately, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been there before and you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the emails you still have to answer. You\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the groceries you need to buy tonight, and why didn\u0026rsquo;t this guy prepare? Here I am and where is he? [00:01:29][12.2]\nPhil: [00:01:30] Absolutely. So you think you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared the presentation but actually you\u0026rsquo;ve not. You\u0026rsquo;ve just prepared some bullet points, which your audience is going to hate and which they\u0026rsquo;re going to forget very quickly. So that is not a proper preparation, but it is ‘putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;. So, if you think about it, ‘putting the cart before the horse’ is going through the process in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is putting the horse before the cart and that means we need to work out what we have to say to our audience, and then afterwards we think: \u0026ldquo;do I need to illustrate that? And if so, how?\u0026rdquo; So preparation for a presentation, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve got limited time - because people always say to us: \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to prepare my presentation properly, so I just have to prepare my slides.\u0026rdquo; No. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a short time, then what you should do is to be thinking: Who is my audience? What are their needs? What are my objectives? And what are the few things they need to remember a week later for me to achieve those objectives? And then you\u0026rsquo;ve got your key messages. You understand your objectives, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have slides you\u0026rsquo;re prepared. If you have your slides but you don\u0026rsquo;t know your key messages, you\u0026rsquo;re not prepared. [00:02:44][74.2]\nRose: [00:02:45] That\u0026rsquo;s it. And luckily we face this all the time at Ideas on Stage, so we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a very simple four step process. One: you ideate. What is this going to be about? What do I need to say? Like Phil mentioned: objectives, key messages. Two: you need to create your presentation. Write it out. Write your storyline. Three: ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I need illustrations? Do I need slides?\u0026rdquo; If you do then you make them! If you don\u0026rsquo;t, fine. Especially in those tight moments when you only have one night to prepare, you might not need the slides. Four: delivery; speaking. That\u0026rsquo;s when you can start to time yourself and check if you know what you need to say ahead. And your audience will thank you. [00:03:31][46.7]\nPhil: [00:03:32] That makes a huge, huge difference. So I will always say rehearsal is necessary. Slides are optional. So if you go into a meeting, if you go into a presentation and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any PowerPoint slides but you do have clear messages and you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable in front of your audience because you have rehearsed it two, three, four, five times then your audience will actually enjoy that far more than a whole load of bullet points behind you. [00:04:00][27.7]\nRose: [00:04:00] Yep. So let\u0026rsquo;s put the \u0026lsquo;horse BEFORE the cart\u0026rsquo;. Prepare. You\u0026rsquo;ve got Ideation, Creation, maybe Illustration and then Speaking and you\u0026rsquo;ll be set. [00:04:09][8.8]\nPhil: [00:04:10] As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u0026rdquo; Creating a lot of slides and bullet points without knowing what you want to say is not preparation, that\u0026rsquo;s an absence of preparation. So if you prepare it properly, if you go into the meeting knowing what you need to say, knowing your objectives, even without slides, you will succeed and your audience will thank you.

This is the reason you, and not somebody else, is on stage to deliver the presentation. The second stake is about your audience: why is it important for them? This is the reason why your audience is there to listen to you instead of doing something else. This is why they should care about your topic. The third stake is about everyone else: why does it truly matter outside of the audience and you? What is the impact of your topic on the world?  If you forget the first stake, then you will not feel engaged. If you forget the second stake, then your audience will not be interested. If you forget the third stake, then nobody else will care about your presentation.\nTake for example a talk about the environmental impact of plastic bottles. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care about that topic, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the first stake. Most probably you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be on stage. The second stake is about \u0026ldquo;why is the topic of plastic bottles important for you, the audience?\u0026rdquo; Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s so we each realize how much plastic we waste each year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because it has direct consequences on our health. The third stake brings perspective. It shows that the problem is not just about a bunch of people in the room, but impacts everyone, even living organisms that are located thousands of kilometers from where the bottle was thrown away. These organisms are essential for our own survival.\nGreat presentations are delivered by someone who cares, to people who will care, about something worth caring about. If the stakes are low, nothing much will happen. If all three stakes are high, then you give yourself a chance of making an impact.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"e2c3681b4bae7b501730c0cdb95f3376","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Storytelling"],"title":"The triple stakes of great presentations","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/03/05/2019-03-05-triple-stakes-of-great-presentations/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"content":"“Don’t worry, I’m experienced, I speak at conferences all the time!” How many times have we heard that sentence from speakers who never did a TEDx style talk, yet think that, because of experience, they can just wing it? For us, it’s not reassuring. Quite the opposite, it’s a clear warning sign that the speaker doesn’t really know what is expected of him. Here are five warning signs that give you clues that your speaker may not be ready to give a TEDx style talk.\n Thinking that traditional speaking experience can replace TEDx specific preparation. We’ve seen many speakers who were very good at giving unstructured talks, or 1h presentations, or improvise during a round table. But giving a TEDx Talk requires a whole different level of commitment and preparation. Make sure your speaker understands what is expected of him. Constantly changing the key topic, storyline or angle. Some speakers seem to be unable to discipline themselves to stick to the planned storyline. They constantly change their mind. After several weeks of preparation they come up with draft version 2453 of their talk, but it’s not better than draft version 1. And on D Day, they want to change their story again. Not putting in the necessary hours to prepare. Nobody can deliver a breakthrough talk without preparing and rehearsing properly. It’s just not possible. Those speakers doing OK Without preparation? They just rehash what they usually say. They don’t cover new ground. They don’t bring new ideas to the table. They just missed a big opportunity to innovate. Not wanting to adapt his presentation. Some speakers are unwilling to move away from what they usually do. Because of the fear of the unknown, the fear of change, or just plain stubbornness. They may not be the best person to speak at your TEDx event. Too passionate to keep an open mind. I have seen several activists who were so passionate about the cause they were defending that they couldn’t conceive others did not necessarily share their views. They spoke passionately about their fight, de facto excluding everyone who didn’t share their point of view, and creating a feeling of aggression in the majority of the public.  In collaboration with the presentation directors, the curator of the event has the responsibility to look for these clues, and if necessary axe the speaker from the program. It’s much better to remove one speaker from the show, even if he’s already announced on the program, than take the risk of a disaster on stage.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"43200e4a7e1771afe65190ce831d4275","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"5 warning signs someone is not ready to speak at your TEDx event","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/02/26/2019-02-26-5-warning-signs-someone-is-not-ready-for-ted/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Pitch","Startup"],"content":"If you’re a Startup founder, you’ve heard this all before. “Your elevator pitch should be able to convince anyone in 30 seconds in an elevator”.

We saw that the best way to fend them off is to strengthen your vital space anchor. But how can you do that?\nIf your presentation has an objective, a clear message, it is much easier to use it as an anchor. Let’s imagine for example that the key message is that your presentation is about a new software service that offers necessary services to protect your IT systems. But the vultures—who don’t really understand what it’s about—are out to eat the tech guy. They question every choice, every detail, every functionality. The presentation turns into an endless discussion of details. If that happens, re-anchor the presentation. Remind them of the objective, the message: “Yes, we can discuss about whether we can add the animated dog on the configuration page later, but this is secondary. What is really important is that we guarantee that we have the right level of protection, and this is the best tool to do it.”\nBullies also like to behave like spoiled children. They throw themselves on the ground, kicking and screaming (mostly figuratively, I haven’t seen someone actually throw himself on the ground—that would have been interesting—but I heard plenty of people screaming to try to cover the sound of their incompetence). They won’t take no as an answer. You know what? No is exactly the answer they need, with a short sentence explaining the consequences, no more. For example: “No, we cannot add this because this would increase the budget / increase the risk / increase delivery time.” The longer your justification is, the more it becomes self-justification, the weaker it becomes, the more mouth-watering you become to the vultures. Be sure to do this only for unjustified requests, not for legitimate concerns or needs. Instead of being the prey, you become the bully’s super nanny. You’re the adult in the room, anchored, with a good message to defend. When you do that, something funny happens. Most bullies instinctively understand they’re starting to look immature and are going to lose their power, and they calm down by themselves. Only the slower ones don’t get it. Be kind to them.\nThe vultures will also try to destabilize you with questions you don’t have the answer. Although not being able to answer any question means you’re not prepared properly (and in that case that’s your problem, not the bully’s problem), it’s perfectly fine and normal not to have 100% of the answers. Just say it. “I don’t have the answer, we will test it and I will come back to you.” See? That simple. You even behaved proactively by proposing to find the answer to the question.\nThese are only a few examples of the techniques you can use to get out of a presentation slump and gain confidence. Anybody willing to invest the time and effort can change and become a good presenter. This is also what a good coach can do for you. He can help you anchor yourself so Vultures will start starving and look elsewhere. He can help you learn to stay firm in hostile environments. He can help you become the good leader people want to follow.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"29313a733f32244549a6ad30f11bd920","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 2)","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/02/12/2019-02-12-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-2/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" The secret ingredient in any presentation is Your Audience. Don’t forget to ask these essential questions to be sure you don’t fail before you’ve even started to speak.\n   Episode 3 “The Audience” Transcript Phil: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your double espresso of presentation know-how.\nRose: [00:00:05] This episode is all about the magic ingredient in any presentation: Your Audience.\nPhil: [00:00:12] So Rose, when I ask people what they hate most about presentations, one thing that comes up all the time is that they hate it when they\u0026rsquo;re receiving a standard presentation, which just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it is suited to that audience.\nRose: [00:00:27] Exactly, Phil. I often think of it like Christmas. So think of your presentation like a gift. Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at Christmas and you\u0026rsquo;re opening your gift and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. You pull off the bow and you look around and at the same time you all pull out\u0026hellip; the same pair of socks. And you realize, \u0026ldquo;Mom, you probably could have done better than all of us having the same pair of socks.\u0026rdquo;\nRose: [00:00:49] Maybe when you\u0026rsquo;re giving gifts you think about what would actually mean something to your grandmother and what would actually mean something to your kids. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;the socks.” So Phil, we have some methodology we use at Ideas on Stage that helps us think about the necessary questions to prepare a presentation for an audience. Can you tell us about that?\nPhil: [00:01:08] Absolutely Rose. So we always start with the ABC. Audience. Burning need. Context. It\u0026rsquo;s the first step. It\u0026rsquo;s so important. And most presenters don\u0026rsquo;t do it. So first off: who is your audience? And you need to get to know your audience beyond simply the title on their business card. Who are they really? I had one chief executive who came to me for example for help with a presentation at a conference and I asked him, \u0026ldquo;So, who\u0026rsquo;s in the audience?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;OK well come back when you do because I can\u0026rsquo;t help you to prepare a successful presentation if we don\u0026rsquo;t know who the audience is.\u0026rdquo; Because the audience is the magic ingredient. So the second part then is the burning need.\nRose: [00:01:53] Oh yes. Your example makes me think. I was working with someone the other day as well and I asked, \u0026ldquo;So, when you\u0026rsquo;re preparing this presentation, what is your team expecting from you in the presentation? Do they need to know numbers? Do they need some moral support? Do they need some reassurance?\u0026rdquo; I looked at him: “[he said] I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Same thing. I said, \u0026ldquo;Okay can you find out? Because this is what\u0026rsquo;s going to guide you in preparing an effective presentation.\u0026rdquo; What are their needs from you? Of course, what is your objective? But what are they expecting?\nPhil: [00:02:27] Yes, you\u0026rsquo;ve always got to start from where they are. That\u0026rsquo;s vital. So often when we\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC with a client they will find that they actually ****don\u0026rsquo;t know some of this information, but they know that they need to find it out. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just asking the right questions. So the \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; then is for context. This is all about how long the presentation is supposed to be. Will there be questions and answers afterwards? Is there somebody else presenting before? If so, what are they presenting? Is there someone presenting afterwards? What time of day is it going to be? For example, is it first thing in the morning? Which is good for getting people to really understand things. Is it first thing in the afternoon? In which case, good luck… All of these things: the technology you have available. Do you have a projector? Do you have sound? Lots of different questions that will help you to understand the context. It\u0026rsquo;s also your audience\u0026rsquo;s business context: is their business going well? Is it not going well? Where are they in the financial cycle? In the sales context: do they already have a supplier? Do they already work with you? All of these things you need to know. And you\u0026rsquo;ll find that when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC it\u0026rsquo;s always just asking the simple but really important questions. And it\u0026rsquo;s the five most important minutes that you can ever spend when preparing a presentation.\nRose: [00:03:45] Excellent Phil. When is this presentation going to happen? Who is it with? I completely agree. So remember: this is not your presentation, it\u0026rsquo;s theirs. The magic ingredient in any presentation is: the Audience. Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s the magic ingredient in your presentation.\nPhil: [00:04:06] Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We\u0026rsquo;ve got so much more to share.

You didn’t manage to shake off your nerves. You became confused. The client or your boss criticized you. Maybe you’ve been caught in a downward spiral for some time, each criticism making you lose confidence, and making the next presentation worse. I have good news for you: no matter what your situation is, this vicious circle can be broken, and you gain the necessary confidence to enjoy presenting.\nHaters are going to hate Before I explain how, let’s put things into context. Haters are going to hate. Some people have a psychological problem, and are there to put others down. This can be to mask their own insecurities and problems, or it can be because they like to bully others. Unfortunately, those types seem to thrive in certain work environments. Stop feeling guilty right now because of these people. They are the ones who have a problem, not you. If that describes your boss, he’s not behaving like the leader he could be. If that describes your client, he does not behave like the competent client he could be. I’m fine with people giving me blunt, critical but honest feedback, even if it may be hard to hear. But I won’t accept people using criticism and attacks to put others down, and nobody should. I will also give you another secret: these vultures are really not that strong. They build their power on charm, fear and submission. But they are hated by everyone. Their subordinates. Their fellow managers or C-level executives. Even their bosses hate them. At the first opportunity everybody will jump ship and abandon them. Once you start to understand that, they are really not that fearsome anymore.\nI started by addressing this point because, in my experience, this is really the factor that makes people doubt themselves and lose their presentation powers. In a secure environment, you feel alright, but as soon as you see the shadows of the vultures circling above your head, you lose confidence. Vultures? Yes, that’s exactly what they are! They are scavengers, they like to prey on perceived weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but they’re really not that courageous. To starve the vultures, you just need to show you are alive and ready to stand firm. How? By strengthening your anchor in your vital space.\nThe goal of the vultures is to reduce your vital space or push you out of it. The vultures are circling around your vital space, they are always trying to invade it by stealing your energy and confidence. It’s only a facade. If you remain anchored, your vital space will protect you and you will be able to fend off all threats with calm and confidence. It will become a natural part of your presentations. Being able to jump out of your vital space is useful, but don’t do it before you have the confidence to do so and learn to do it without turning into a vulture.\nIn the second part I will explain several techniques to stay anchored and protect your vital space, and scare off the presentation vultures.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"d0e0b5a4d67af00b57b74e810fbb9fb8","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 1)","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/02/05/2019-02-05-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-1/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Training","Krauthammer","Presentations"],"content":"A few weeks ago, Ideas on Stage had the privilege of organizing a sales presentation training for Krauthammer at Dolce La Hulpe, close to Brussels in Belgium. For us, delivering a training for dozens of senior people at Krauthammer, one of the world’s most respected sales and management training companies, felt like designing something for Jonathan Ive, Apple’s legendary designer: a bit intimidating but incredibly exciting.\nThe training met with great success, and it was fantastic to work with such talented people, but what I will remember most are two presentations. During the hands-on course, groups prepared a sales pitch, and at the end of the day, each group had to deliver its presentation in front of the others.\nThe first group was stunning! The beginning of the presentation used the music from “Also sprach Zarathustra” from Richard Strauss, the piece you hear in the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey when mankind discovers the use of tools. Not speaking at all, just pointing to a few words at a time on the slides to deliver his key message. He had his audience’s attention fully captured!\nBoy, was the second group in trouble. How can you beat such a brilliant presentation? Well, the second presenter calmly and confidently went on stage. And started singing the tune of “Also sprach Zarathustra” live! Everybody, impressed by his boldness and his clever and humorous improvisation, feeling fully connected and present, started singing along. Using great body language to increase the dramatic effect, he stole the show. After doing this he simply said “This is how we do it at Krauthammer. We don’t do playback, we always do it live!” Everybody laughed and had a great time. This is exactly the kind of presentation they will still remember and talk about next year, whereas countless other boring presentations will have been long forgotten.\nThey probably won’t do that in front of a real client. But they will remember the need to be memorable. By default, your audience will forget everything you say—fast. It’s up to you to find a way to make your messages stick. (With or without singing.)\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"cf0b56390c390d9ef82c55964e41ccac","tags":["Public Speaking","Training","Krauthammer","Presentations"],"title":"How to steal the show","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/29/2019-01-29-how-to-steal-the-show/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali"],"content":"I know, paraphrasing the motto of the great Muhammad Ali, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”, doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yet my point is that in a debate it is extremely important to listen and move with a maximum of agility, and talk with a maximum of punch.\nTake the example of the Gilets jaunes controversy in France. The government was completely taken by surprise by the popularity of the movement. Their initial listening position lacked agility and guile. They were perceived as static, which gave the impression, justified or not, that they were not listening at all. Their counters used words that didn’t have any punch, believing that the threat would disappear by itself.\nOnly after receiving glancing blows to the head did they start to realize how serious their situation was, and how much their strength had already been sapped. The president tried to counter. He had good arguments and gave away a lot, but only got more attacks in return. Why? Because he used his arguments inefficiently. Instead of using them in a way that would have made the movement pause and doubt, he threw away his best shots, he gave the impression he was losing, and that gave more confidence and energy to his opponents.\nWhen under attack, if you counter weakly, it only strengthens your opponent and saps your morale. Start by floating (listening) like a butterfly, put yourself in a favorable position, then sting (speak) like a bee when the time is right.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f6421febecff76b83ba8ce3f1b522842","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali"],"title":"Listen like a butterfly, talk like a bee","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/22/2019-01-22-listen-like-a-butterfly-talk-like-a-bee/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Rose asks Phil how to overcome your fear before a big presentation, and turn it into positive energy on stage.

Phil, is everything okay?\nPhil: I\u0026rsquo;m just really feeling kind of nervous. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m properly prepared for today.\nRose: Well you\u0026rsquo;re in luck because today\u0026rsquo;s episode is all about calming presentation nerves. We all get them. (Phil, we\u0026rsquo;re recording.) So right before we were talking about how to calm presentation nerves. Before we get into some solutions, let\u0026rsquo;s take a stage fright diagnostic. Phil, can I ask you a few questions about how you feel? Is your heart racing? How\u0026rsquo;s your voice? Can you try saying something?\nPhil: It\u0026rsquo;s kind of dry and hard to get it out.\nRose: OK. Are you able to focus? Can you look straight ahead for a moment? Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to keep direct eye contact.\nPhil: I \u0026rsquo;m just too stressed.\nRose: O K, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can find where the issue arose. So, thinking about preparing for your \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; today: did you prepare in a four-part process and think about the ideas and creating the presentation?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you rehearse? Did you try to practice a few times, maybe even five or six times?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you get some sleep last night? Maybe six hours or more?\nPhil: No.\nRose: All right. And\u0026hellip; did you have coffee?\nPhil: Yes. (-Two.)\nRose: Yeah, I know you Phil. OK. So here are a few common traps and things that will absolutely activate your nerves. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that Phil?\nPhil: Well absolutely because to be honest stage fright happens to everybody. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t get stage fright you do get nerves. Now I speak in public all the time but I do get nervous before a major presentation. We all do. It was Mark Twain who said, “the world only has two categories of speakers: the nervous and the liars.” So we all get it, right? The question is, how do we make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t paralyze us and how do we actually channel that nervous energy and give that energy to our audience rather than letting it paralyze us like it did me a few moments ago.\nRose: Absolutely. And that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of where our work comes in as coaches. We work with people all the time to help them relax and get centered, but also just to learn how to prepare well. There is one other thing we didn\u0026rsquo;t touch on and this is sort of a back-pocket, secret weapon towards nerves and that is: the energy or feeling that\u0026rsquo;s running through your body coming out as trembles sometimes, this is fear. But on the other side of fear is excitement. So connecting to your purpose and what is actually exciting you about presenting, this can really help energize you in a positive way. And remember, this isn\u0026rsquo;t your presentation. This is theirs. So get out of yourself. Come back to the preparation. Avoid the coffee if you can. Get some good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prepare.\nPhil: Absolutely. Always focus not on what could go wrong but think about what could go right. Imagine your audience enjoying your presentation, getting your key messages and then achieving your objectives because it\u0026rsquo;s up to them to achieve your objectives for you. So imagine all of that happening. Visualize that happening and it helps a lot. But, you know what I find? It’s that rehearsing your presentation, knowing that that presentation is well-prepared and is going to hit the target with that audience is actually more than half the battle. The rest of it is making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not putting your body in a stressful situation by having coffee, which is wonderful if you want to be productive and creative, but it\u0026rsquo;s not great when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking because not only does it make you speak a lot faster, which actually reduces your credibility, it also dries out your throat and it increases your stress levels. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing that when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting.\nRose: So, three things to remember: one, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Everybody gets presentation nerves, even Phil. Two, prepare and rehearse. Three, take care of your body and your body will take care of you.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n You’re not alone: we all get nerves. Prepare and rehearse to turn fear into excitement. Take care of your body: avoid coffee, get good sleep, and breathe.  Phil: Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Whatever works for you.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you look at the comments in the thread, it seems other attendees agree with him. The average level of the talks was perceived as unprepared and boring. That\u0026rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is, if you prepare well, you have a good chance to stand out and get noticed. And we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about a small event: we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the CES, one of the biggest shows on the planet.\nWe trained people to speak at CES before, including people who felt they were great and didn\u0026rsquo;t need training. It often shocked them when we told them they were not ready, especially people nobody dared to criticize.\nWe often wonder why people invest so little time in what might be the most important thing after actually having a (good) product: their pitch or presentation. There\u0026rsquo;s no miracle. That guy who was a great showman and seemed so natural? He rehearsed – a lot. He took the time to write a great speech and illustrate it with great visuals. He took the time to rehearse, and was coached by professionals.\nYou may think you\u0026rsquo;re just going to wing it. But that won\u0026rsquo;t fly. If you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready, do this test. Ask the best presenter you know to give you honest, unfiltered feedback on your presentation. If you hesitate to do so, maybe you should ask yourself why.\nAs a post-script, if you are organizing an important event, don’t leave anything to chance. Hire a specialist team of presentation coaches, and make sure every speaker gets help with story, slides and speaking. Some speakers may need less help than others - that’s fine. But a speaker who doesn’t have the time to prepare with a coach isn’t going to prepare properly anyway, and a speaker who feels he is too important to be helped will probably be so full of himself that he won’t adapt to your audience. Neither of these speakers has any place on your stage.\nMake sure your speakers shine – otherwise, the only things people will remember from your event are tweets like Rene’s.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"4f2f1fa076a270b964998789b2d21d29","tags":["Presentation","Public Speaking","CES","Coaching"],"title":"I presented at CES and all I got was a bunch of ungrateful tweets","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/15/2019-01-14-i-presented-at-ces-and-all-i-got-was-a-bunch-of-ungrateful-tweets/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"content":"By now, you’ve probably heard that Apple was doomed.

First, Tim Cook’s letter is more than 1300 words. In comparison, Steve’s was fewer than 200 words. It’s much easier to get the key message from 200 words than 1300. Shorter communications are much more effective. In fact, I read Steve’s profit warning very quickly, whereas I had to force myself to read through the entirety of Tim’s letter.\nWhy does this matter? It’s especially important because in such a communication, whether written or delivered during a presentation, the information you want people to pay attention to should be at the end. It follows this structure:\n Acknowledge the elephant in the room. We’re going to miss our financial guidance numbers. It doesn’t have to be long. Just tell them how much, and why. Don’t try to mess around finding pathetic excuses: that just adds more fuel to the rumor fire. Give context. Is it really just an Apple problem? No. The slowdown is affecting all players in the industry. Go in for the kill. Out of all players, Apple is the one that remains by far the most profitable, and looking ahead is in the best position to face the future.  The third point is really the key message, the one you want everybody to remember. If your delivery is too long, a lot of people will only remember the first point. That you are doomed.\nIf you have to deliver bad news in a presentation, this is how you should do it. Be as succinct as possible. Start with the bad news, provide context, then conclude with the key positive message.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b3065cf1ca6b17f1dd89f610dbf7d58b","tags":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"title":"What presentation lessons can we learn from Apple’s profit warning?","type":"news","url":"/news/2019/01/08/2019-01-07-what-presentation-lessons-can-we-learn-from-apples-profit-warning/"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","categories":["Presentation","Tips","Transform","Prepare","Objective","Meeting","Impact","Efficient"],"content":"Too many presentations aim only to inform, yet this is one thing oral presentations are particularly bad at \u0026ndash; we forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds.\nIf you want people to remember information, give them a document and a coffee, and time to read.

Guest: Phil Waknell\n   Text transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your regular cup of presentation inspiration.\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at why presentation should rhyme not with Information but with Transformation.\nRose: [00:00:16] So Phil, you said that presentations should rhyme with transformation instead of information. What do you mean by that?\nPhil: [00:00:23] Well, far too many presentations simply aim to inform the audience, to transfer neurons, brain cells, from the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain to the audience\u0026rsquo;s brain. And you know what? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because we don\u0026rsquo;t have perfect memories. Do you have a perfect memory?\nRose: [00:00:40] Unfortunately no.\nPhil: [00:00:41] We forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that try and remember what I said 30 seconds ago. That\u0026rsquo;s really really hard. So if you aim only to inform the audience then you\u0026rsquo;ll fail. If you want to give them information then give them a document, give them a coffee and give them some time so they can read that document. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective but a presentation is fantastic for transforming the audience.\nPhil: [00:01:07] It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic for changing something in what the audience believes, in what they feel and in what they do. So always ask yourself this question when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting: \u0026ldquo;After this presentation the audience will ____.\u0026rdquo; What? What will they believe differently, what will they feel differently, what will they do differently. And that\u0026rsquo;s your objective.\nRose: [00:01:33] I completely agree Phil and what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is that unfortunately I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been trained pretty wrong, even in our schools, when we grow up we\u0026rsquo;re taught to give information first, to value the information. But what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is we don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do that and it\u0026rsquo;s not the most effective place: in a boardroom, in a presentation. And what we can do instead is focus on making a change in what they know, what they believe, what they feel and what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do after the presentation. Is that right?\nPhil: [00:02:07] That\u0026rsquo;s absolutely right. I think the real key point is that the main subject of your presentation is not the information you have to tell them\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s the audience. It\u0026rsquo;s all about them and it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you need to transform them in order to achieve your objectives.\nPhil: [00:02:24] You may need to put some information into that presentation of course, in order to achieve those objectives, but it\u0026rsquo;s all about the transformation. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve got information that does not support your transformational objective then take it out because what you take out will actually reinforce what you leave in.\nRose: [00:02:43] So this reminds me, yesterday when I was coaching this young executive at one of the larger French companies we work with, he is working on his communication style. And when you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to an executive team you know very well you need to be brief. You need to say what needs to be said directly. Well another thing we talked about is in his presentation he will only have 20 minutes to actually motivate his team to take action on a project. This is not the time to inform them of all the bullet points that go into \u0026lsquo;why the project\u0026rsquo;, the action plan, etc. This is the time to motivate them, reassure them, make them feel confident and supported. And I saw the light bulb go on for him yesterday. And I think it can for all of us when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about how we design a presentation.\nPhil: [00:03:33] Absolutely. So always remember if your only aim is information, well cancel your presentation and give them a document and a coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective. But if you actually have an aim of transforming your audience, motivating them like with your client there or making them want to buy something or making them desire something or just making them believe something different: well, that\u0026rsquo;s your objective. Build everything around that.\nPhil: [00:03:58] And remember that what you tell them they\u0026rsquo;ll probably forget, but what they feel and what they get out of it in terms of transformation: that will last. And that\u0026rsquo;s what makes an effective presentation.\nRose: [00:04:15] Phil, now that would be a real revolution. Thank you for watching. We hope we have transformed how you think of presentations.\n[00:04:23] And we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot more to share. So, please subscribe to our YouTube channel or wherever you get your podcasts.

Ideas on Stage may not be a tech company, but we have helped thousands of start-ups with their pitches, and partner with many accelerators including Ashoka’s ShareIT.io, based at Station F. So we are very much part of the French Tech ecosystem, and very interested in how it is evolving under its new Director, our good friend Kat Borlongan. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t present for the event at Station F, you can catch the playback on Facebook LIVE here.\nIt’s no surprise to see Macron supporting tech entrepreneurs: while Economy Minister a few years back, he was regularly seen at tech events and even CES. But taking live questions, on a day when his government was under fire about the time it is taking over the cabinet reshuffle, was brave to say the least.\nMost politicians would have ensured questions were ‘planted’ in the audience, or simply gathered questions beforehand and addressed them in turn. Macron did neither. Questions were taken from a sea of raised hands by Kat Borlongan, not by Macron, and I know first-hand that those questions were chosen at random.\nI’m not going to comment on the politics or the quality of his answers. (I always try to stay out of politics.) But I will cover three important points that speakers can learn from what Macron did very well, and two more from what he could still improve.\n\n1. Improvisation requires preparation\nIf Macron was able to listen to unprepared questions and seem completely at ease responding to them – on subjects as varied as diversity, anti-trust, ed-tech, visas and even pesticides – it is because he was extremely well-briefed.\nBirds can ‘wing it’. Presenters cannot. Macron knew when taking this stage that he would have to deal with a wide variety of subjects, and at no stage did he seem lost or short of an answer, plus he did not dodge any question as politicians tend to do. Whether you agree with his policies or not, he is certainly very well-informed.\nImprovisation is hard for anyone (and impossible for some). There is a danger that presenters think that their choice is either to prepare very well, or to improvise and therefore not need to prepare. That is wrong. Macron gave a fine example of how strong preparation makes you ready to improvise.\nPreparation is always the difference between weak and strong communication. Whether you are learning a speech or preparing a Q\u0026amp;A session, Benjamin Franklin’s famous words always apply: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”\n\n2. Dare to surprise\nOne question received its own round of applause, because it resonated with so many entrepreneurs in the audience. The questioner explained that he finds it difficult to recruit employees because of the very high employers’ social charges, which mean in France that an employee costs far more than they actually take home. “My enemy is the URSSAF,” (the French Social Security agency).\nMacron took a moment to reflect on this statement and the audience’s sympathetic applause, and replied: “The URSSAF is your friend.”\n   \nIt would have been very easy to sympathize, and then to explain what his government is doing to reduce social security charges and government spending, but Macron chose a daring approach. He chose to say the opposite of what most entrepreneurs in the room believed. Immediately the audience had a tweetable, newsworthy statement, and he had everybody’s attention.\nHe then went on to defend the French social model, and the importance of social security, while later saying that they are working to lower social charges and make hiring easier. But that would not have been as powerful without his daring, controversial statement that everybody will easily remember days and weeks later.\nDare to surprise your audience. They will sit up and pay attention – and that is half the battle for any speaker.\n\n3. Smile, and the audience smiles with you\nOne improvement I have noticed in Macron’s speaking behavior over the years has been his smile. While his predecessor François Hollande strove in vain to appear presidential, and therefore always tried to seem serious and grave, Macron appears to believe in his ideas and policies, and he is now visibly positive when he explains them.\nSmiling is important for two reasons. First, when we smile, the audience can hear it. Our words sound more positive, more engaging, and less boring. Try this on the phone, or try to listen on your next call. You can tell whether your correspondent is smiling.\nThe second reason is that we all have mirror neurons which unconsciously perceive and reproduce the emotions we perceive in others. If you see a speaker who appears negative, demotivated, or even bored, then you will experience the same feelings. If however you see a speaker who is positive, who speaks with passion, who clearly believes what she is saying, then you will feel the same way.\nMacron appeared to enjoy the exchange yesterday. He seemed positive in explaining his policies. That made it so much easier for the audience to feel equally positive.\n\nSo those are three important lessons any speaker can learn from President Macron’s exchange yesterday. Here are two more speaking tips, which Macron can still improve on, and which we can all benefit from employing more.\n\n4. Short answers are best\nIn a session where there are potentially hundreds of questions, answering only a handful of them will leave many people disappointed, and many subjects uncovered. This may be easier for the speaker, but it is not better for the audience. While Macron’s initial speech was refreshingly short, his answers to most of the questions were very long. Although he tried to make it up by staying longer than planned and taking four questions at the end when Kat had said there was time for only one, it would have been a far more dynamic, interesting and fruitful exchange if he had taken twice as many questions, and answered each one in half the time.\nWhy? The danger when you give a long answer is that people forget the question, or they forget the beginning of your answer when you get to the end. It is also usually true that much of the audience has no interest in the answer to some questions, therefore it is wise not to take too long unless the answer is of clear interest to everybody. For example, the first question yesterday was about EdTech which is an important niche but a niche nonetheless, and after several minutes, anyone not in that niche was left wondering when Macron would finish and move on to a subject they might care about.\nAim to keep any answer to no more than two minutes. When you set yourself this limit, you will be amazed at what you can say in those two minutes, and it will be more powerful than a comprehensive 5-minute answer.\n\n5. Finish with a flourish\nMany speakers fail to pay attention to the end of their speech, or the end of their sentences. Yesterday, Macron was able to speak clearly and coherently for minutes on end, but then once he would start to wrap-up his answers, he appeared to run out of words, or out of breath, and tail off. Twice the audience though he had finished, and applauded when in fact he had not properly completed his sentence. On several other occasions, it was clear he was already thinking of the next sentence, and lost power at the end of the current sentence in his haste to begin the next. This is one of the most common problems I encounter when helping speakers.\nSadly this lackluster finish also happened right at the very end of the evening when Macron gave a call to action to the entrepreneurs in the room. This was an excellent way to finish, but unfortunately the last sentence tailed off, and ended up with slightly awkward applause punctuated by a slightly embarrassed “Voilà” from the President.\n\nThink of a sentence like a two-headed match. It should begin powerfully, like striking the head of a match causing it to burst into flame. Then, keep your message burning, ensuring nobody switches off. And finally, at the end, when a typical match or dull statement would normally sizzle out into silence, suddenly and surprisingly, it reignites in flame!\n(This analogy also goes for any presentation. Start strong, and finish with a flourish.)\nMacron could benefit from practicing conclusions. And any speaker can gain power and credibility by ensuring they finish each sentence – especially the final one – clearly and powerfully. Even when improvising. And if you have prepared well, you will likely have already generated several possible conclusions you can use that will ensure a big round of applause.\n\nPresident Macron is a powerful, confident communicator. And even though he is already a highly skilled speaker, he is not yet the finished article, and he continues to improve. That in itself should be a lesson to us all: every speaker, no matter how good, has potential to further develop and stretch their skills. It comes through practice, a desire to improve, and through a deep respect for your audience that drives you to give them the best experience possible.\nMacron gave French Tech a great experience yesterday. I have no doubt he’ll be even better next time.\nPhotos © Ideas on Stage 2018\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"2422ba353fc44ac63a35ceec4a5ef83d","tags":["Speaking","Lessons","President","French","Macron","Talk","Technique","Tips","Learning","Present","Tech","Station F","Paris","Politics",""],"title":"5 Speaking Lessons from President Macron","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/10/10/2018-10-10-5-speaking-lessons-from-president-macron/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["speaking; event design; presentation; coaching; montage; video; promo"],"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s already October and you know what that means\u0026hellip; Firming up plans for next year.

A board meeting is not a stage with a round red carpet. Yet businesses can and should learn a few vital lessons from TED, and apply them to their own presentations.\nWhat makes TED talks different from most business presentations? Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on three key factors.\n**1. Short talks are better **\nOne of the key rules at TED is that no presentation can last more than 18 minutes, no matter who is speaking. Businesses should take note. We always used to ask ourselves the question: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation long enough to tell them everything I want to say?\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact a better question would be: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation short enough to keep their attention and ensure they remember my key messages?\u0026rdquo;\nAttention spans are short, and in an oral presentation people forget most of what they hear within 30 seconds, so the more you say, the less they remember of it. Better to say little, but to say it effectively. Remember the words of Baltasar Gracián: \u0026ldquo;Good things, when short, are twice as good.\u0026rdquo;\n**2. Slides are visual aids, not cheat-sheets or handouts **\nMany TED talks do not use any slides. They are not always necessary, and many business presentations do not need them either. Frankly, any business presentation would be more effective with no slides than with bad, text-heavy slides that actually stop the audience from listening to the speaker. People simply cannot read and listen at the same time, so the more text you put on your slide, the less you are communicating.\nTED speakers do not use slides as their cheat-sheets: slides, where they are used, are visual aids to help the audience to understand and remember their key messages. Business presenters should use them in the same way. If you need a cheat-sheet or notes to remember the flow of your presentation, that\u0026rsquo;s fine: keep it on a card or piece of paper in front of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t project it behind you. If you need to distribute information so your audience has a record of what you said, give them a short standalone document that summarizes your key messages, but don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that your slides will do that job. If they are good visual aids, they will not be a good handout.\nUse slides only where needed, and make sure they follow the 5-second rule: every time you click, the audience should be able to \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; the new content in under 5 seconds. Otherwise they will stop listening to you, and the communication will be broken.\n**3. Preparation is the key to success **\nEvery TED speaker prepares their talk over a period of several months, with the help of professional presentation coaches. At Ideas on Stage, we\u0026rsquo;ve helped many hundreds of TED and TEDx speakers to imagine and create a fascinating talk, to illustrate it with breathtaking visual aids, and to prepare mentally and physically to take the stage and speak convincingly to their audience. Preparation is the key to success.\nFor most business presentations, you won\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of spending months fine-tuning your talk with specialist help. You have limited time and need to spend it wisely. But you can still prepare well, and your audience deserves a well-prepared presentation.\nIf your time is limited, don\u0026rsquo;t waste it all producing slides. Slides are always optional, sometimes nice-to-have, but never necessary - especially if you are anyway giving your audience a short hand-out. Rehearsal, however, is required. If your presentation lasts 18 minutes - and ideally it should not be much longer - then it only takes an hour to rehearse it three times. The fourth time will be far more convincing than the first.\nSo if you have limited time, skip the slides but take an hour to rehearse. It will be time well-spent and your presentation will be far more powerful as a result.\nSummary\nBusiness can learn many lessons from the success of TED, starting with these three:\n Short talks are better: don\u0026rsquo;t say too much, but say it effectively Slides are visual aids: don\u0026rsquo;t use them as cheat-sheets or handouts Preparation is the key to success: take the time to prepare and rehearse  There are many more: for example, your introduction should create an emotional reaction that makes the audience want to listen; and we remember information far better when it\u0026rsquo;s told in the form of a story or example. Those rules are just as applicable in business.\nIf you apply these lessons to your next business presentation, the result might not look like a TED talk, but it will have a much better chance of energizing and inspiring its participants than a poorly-prepared speaker muddling through a bunch of boring bullet-points.\nYour audiences deserve successful presentations, and your business depends on them.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about TEDifying your business presentations, contact us at info@ideasonstage.com or fill in the form below and we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you quickly.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"38de4b73d8f50ae01a752df6e666b2cc","tags":["TED","TEDx","business presentation","tips"],"title":"What Business Can Learn From TED","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/04/10/2018-04-10-what-business-can-learn-from-ted/"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","categories":["stage fright","presenting","fear"],"content":" Fear doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove the danger. Embrace it and get on top of your presentations.\n \u0026ldquo;There is nothing to fear but fear itself\u0026rdquo; - a memorable line from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026rsquo;s inaugural address in 1932 at the depths of the Great Depression. At the time he may not have realized it, but his words are among the most powerful pieces of advice for public speaking.\nAfter all, what we all fear in presentations is succumbing to fear. Losing our cool, forgetting what needs to be said, not convincing the audience enough. Failing in front of our peers. Doubt, doubt and more doubt.\nBut fear is often generated and worsened by inaction. How many of us do not act when faced by our fears? Fear is a mechanism of the mind to forewarn us, an alarm that lets us know that danger lies ahead and we should do something about it before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nThe science behind fear is well-documented. Many of us have heard of the \u0026ldquo;fight or flight\u0026rdquo; instinct. For a speaker, these two extreme actions are manifested by the loss of presence from either shrinking and hiding from an audience (\u0026ldquo;flight\u0026rdquo;) or coming out swinging or trying to control them (\u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo;). The third extreme reaction is to \u0026ldquo;freeze\u0026rdquo; - the presentation equivalent of \u0026ldquo;playing dead\u0026rdquo;.\nThe natural balance where you can make a true connection with an audience comes from confidence and relaxation. Some of us are better equipped to deal with fear, while some of us are not stable enough to manage it well. We can all benefit, though, from reducing unnecessary sources of fear that cause stress we can do without.\nThe following 7 steps may not be a cure for everyone, particularly those with deep fears linked to public speaking, but they are a very good start.\n1. Master your content - don\u0026rsquo;t let it master you.\nThere are often parts of a presentation where the speaker does not entirely master what he or she is talking about. These knowledge gaps can be stressful, and trying to explain something that you have not fully mastered will bring a negative feedback loop from the audience as they struggle to understand. Present only what you master, and master everything you present.\n2. Rehearse aloud in advance with your slides and timer.\nRehearsing aloud is the best thing any speaker can do, but also the rarest. We can spend hours tweaking messages or putting polish on slides, but never enough time on our feet rehearsing. Use a timer so you know exactly how long your presentation takes, and ensure you only take 90% of your allotted time so that on the day you are not stressed about overrunning.\n3. Connect with your audience.\nIf you can meet members of the audience prior to a presentation, this can be hugely beneficial. You must not think like an actor waiting in the wings until the curtain rises. This makes the task harder. Knowing at least some of your audience, and knowing they are not dragons, will reduce your fear and stress.\n4. Check that everything works.\nTechnical problems can disrupt a presentation, but even if it all ends up running smoothly, the fear of technical problems can be very destabilizing for a presenter. Many presentations have sunk due to last minute problems with slides, compatibility issues (software and hardware), fonts not downloaded, resolution issues, not having the right adaptor, etc. Solution? Get there early and take the time to ensure all slides and videos look good in real conditions - on the actual computer and actual screen - and you will save yourself a lot of worry, and reduce your stress levels. You should also find the technician in charge of the room. They are your best friend.

Trust yourself.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t rehearse your presentation 101 times. Trust your subconscious mind and leave a little margin for the unknown. You\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it more.\n6. Avoid coffee.\nThis should be obvious but many speakers don\u0026rsquo;t realize how important it is. Don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee before presenting, especially if you know you are sensitive to it. Caffeine not only increases your stress levels: it also dries out your mouth and throat, so your voice is less resonant and less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ve trained coffee companies and they know this - so should you!\n7. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of being afraid.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m back to the original quotation. If you accept that everyone feels fear when they take the stage, even the greatest speakers, then you can also accept that stress is the body\u0026rsquo;s way of preparing you to perform at your best.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate all stress when presenting, and you would perform worse if you did. These tips will help you to remove unnecessary stress, leaving you with just enough so you can master it, and use it to deliver your best.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"f5cb107fbd20923a59f922a84ee39867","tags":["stage fright","presenting","fear"],"title":"7 Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Presenting","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/04/09/2018-04-10-7-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-presenting/"},{"author":"Marion Chapsal","categories":["News","Presentations","Tips"],"content":" Have you seen Gary Oldman in his interpretation of Churchill in the latest biopic by Joe Wright? If you have not, please go. It’s jaw-dropping. His outstanding performance may very soon win him an Oscar. You will enjoy some of the finest acting and also benefit from precious presentation lessons from the Master Orator.\nHere are 3 takeaways from the movie, which you can immediately apply for your next keynote, sales meeting or investor pitch.\n\n1. Sit down and listen. \n  © Working Title Films—@Working_Title\n \nIn one scene, likely fictional according to the critics, Churchill decides to go and meet the people.\nHe takes his first-ever ride on a London Underground train, and begins asking random citizens if they would fight the Nazis even if the odds were stacked against them? They reply in one clear, loud and vibrant voice: “Never surrender!”\nThere and then, Churchill’s decision to refuse peace talks with Hitler is strengthened. He rushes to deliver what will become one of his most powerful speeches, taking into account these citizens’ words, quoting them and even crediting them by name.\nI loved this scene and frankly do not care whether it happened or not. In fact, it resembles the coaching advice I recently gave to the Senior Manager of an international company during one of our first sessions. As we explored the context of his annual strategy presentation, using Ideas on Stage methodologies like the ABCs (Audience, Burning Needs, Context), I gently guided him through a series of discovery questions. He soon realized he had only the vaguest sense of his audience: what was their experience? What did they most want and need from him in his speech?\n“Why don’t you learn directly from your people?” I offered. Ask them. Wait. Listen quietly. Put yourself in their shoes. Thank them. And then reflect back.\nSo, during the Christmas holidays, he collected feedback and stories from his teams across Europe. In his talk, delivered before several hundred sales managers, he incorporated several personal stories that made the difference. “Wendy from the UK told me…, Karl from Germany…, etc.” He truly connected with his audience and showed them he cared.\n\u0026ldquo;Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”—Winston Churchill\n\n2. Prepare to sweat. Maybe not blood and tears, but certainly sweat. In this movie, we see once again how Churchill literally perspires over the writing of his speeches. Even to the point of “steaming”. Just like Steve Jobs, Churchill was not a “born speaker”. And we believe no-one is.\nHe drafted his speeches many times over, until the very last moment. He dictated them to a secretary. Perhaps today he would use his iPhone to record himself and save some poor girl’s nerves. He then rehearsed passages, again and again, pacing up and down his room, repeating them aloud, learning whole speeches by heart.\nAs we coach CEOs, start-up entrepreneurs, doctors and TEDx speakers, we are often asked: “How long will the preparation last? How many sessions will it take?” The answer: it all depends on how dedicated you are to the task and its success. How much are you willing to invest in your success? It takes true dedication and involves many hours of lonely drafting, stumbling over words, pausing and rewriting. And then again, iterations with visuals. And rehearsals. Out loud. Again and again.\nIt’s a performance. It involves your whole brain, your whole body. Your full presence. That’s why leaders seek out seasoned presentation coaches for this delicate mental, emotional and physical preparation.\n\n3. Embrace imperfection and fear. Churchill wasn’t born a master orator—he overcame a childhood lisp by painstakingly practicing enunciation. He also always took his notes with him and would sometimes appear to stumble or hesitate, all in order to make a calculated effect.\nHe knew that a speech which is too perfect, with almost robotic delivery, would put people to sleep. He knew that the more conversational and simple a speech sounded, the more tuned in his audience would be. There is a very touching scene when King George VI asks Churchill if he is afraid. “I am most terribly. Terribly afraid,” admits Churchill.\nDuring our coaching sessions and workshops, we pay attention to vulnerability. We don’t aim at perfection; we aim rather to bring out your authentic best. In the intimate space of trust and acceptance created between the coach and the speaker, fear is invited, politely. And then just as politely, we make sure she keeps quiet. This way we free up the space to hear the voice of passion, care, enthusiasm.\nSpeaking in public doesn’t require you to be fearless. It requires you to speak through the fear.\n\nCall to Action: Next time you find yourself getting prepared to give a presentation, remember these 3 simple tips from The Darkest Hour and prepare to give your finest talk yet:\n− Be brave enough to listen to your audience—and if you have no idea what they are thinking, feeling, believing or doing, find out!\n− Spend the time to write and craft your messages, and practice them aloud. Then review, edit and iterate.\n− If you feel the shadows of fear—inner critics, voices of comparison, or even shame—begin by acknowledging the feeling. It’s OK: you are human. Then come back to your passion, your purpose for presenting, and move forward.\nDo not attempt to be perfect or fearless. Dare to prepare, and dare to present.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"7ad8dc5b94d78243b3e8e48eda68498b","tags":["News","Presentations","Tips"],"title":"3 presentation lessons from The Darkest Hour","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/02/16/2018-02-16-the-darkest-hour-presentation-lessons/"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","categories":["Design","Brand"],"content":"I am not a naive man. I have reasonable doubts that Santa does not really exist. So instead of writing a letter that I knew he would not answer I thought it was time to refresh the Ideas on Stage Brand, which hasn’t changed since the creation of the company in 2010.\nWe started with the font. We really love Gotham, the masterpiece from Tobias Frere-Jones. Its iconic design is built on a strong lineage of geometric sans serif fonts. It’s been used with great success by Obama’s campaign and on bags of crisps. We think it conveys the image of professionalism and reliability that we carry with us everywhere.\nNext was the logo. The original one drew some of its inspiration from an old Apple app for podcasts. But despite investing a significant number of minutes in its design it was definitely lacking subtlety and refinement. We tried many different ideas, some good, some “interesting”. In the end we decided we wanted to keep a link with our beginnings, and at the same time add subtle clues about who we are. The new logo has three circles. The big orange one represents the presence of the Speaker on stage. The small white circle is the head of the Speaker, the dot on the i of ideas, and the inner circle. The small orange circle breaks with the mold; it’s the outer circle, the one where the Speaker moves forward and connects with the audience.\nAfter working on the font and logo, I still had time to write a letter to Santa. But instead we chose to spend time on refreshing the look of our website, to our new visual identity. We simplified the navigation and made it more visual.\nBy then it was early January and too late to write my letter to Santa. I don’t believe in him but I hope he hasn’t blacklisted me for next year.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"219f72c5efca3d4d404a044bbf6fe29f","tags":["Design","Brand"],"title":"New brand, new design","type":"news","url":"/news/2018/01/26/2018-01-26-new-brand-new-design/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["France","TEDx","Event"],"content":" For the third year running, Ideas on Stage was very happy to partner with the TEDx Saclay conference, which took place this November 30, 2017 in the brand-new CentraleSupélec amphitheater at the Plateau de Saclay on the powerful theme of “Serving the Living”.\nTEDx Saclay Keeping standards typically high, this year’s event boasted a rich program of speakers including a few notably prestigious guests such as Cédric Villani \u0026ndash; renowned mathematician and member of the French National Assembly \u0026ndash; as well as artists, scientists, students, entrepreneurs and even a Guinness World Record gamer (Kayane).

From Friday September 29th through Sunday evening on the 1st of October, Marion Chapsal and her co-facilitator Evelyn McKelvie will guide eight willing and ready women on a journey to find \u0026ndash; or fine-tune \u0026ndash; their public voice and take the stage alongside, you guessed it, horses. They call this workshop and retreat \u0026ldquo;The Heroine\u0026rsquo;s Journey\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Evelyn’s June article on “Slaying the Dragon of Fear”, it’s clear that she and Marion share a synergy in their coaching mission even though they come from opposite ends of the pond, as in Canada and France.\nExcuse me? Let me back up. Like Marion, Evelyn is a longtime Leadership Coach, working with Corporate Executives mainly through facilitating retreats. However, she is also the Founder of Equine Coach, an organization which “focuses on leadership development, mindfulness, and enhanced communication skills through working and playing with horses”.\nShe sees how spending hands-on time with horses is a transformational learning opportunity that connects people back to nature and their own intuitive emotional intelligence.\nIn Evelyn’s words: “Whether or not you are a corporate leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, an aspiring politician or activist, or a mom who wants to be a role model for her daughter”, being comfortable speaking with a microphone, being filmed or taking the stage in any way is key to building and flourishing in a career.\nMarion Chapsal, Chief Learning Officer and creator of Women on Stage, is also fully aware of this truth. Why? Because having worked with countless professionals including young female entrepreneurs to global political leaders, her life’s work is dedicated in many ways to nourishing and reinforcing women’s power and presence in their life and work, on or off-stage.\nWhen answering the question “Why women only workshops?” Marion answers:\n Women really get to speak! They\u0026rsquo;re less likely to be interrupted, and if they are, they will not remain silent as they might when interrupted by a man.\n Women more easily overcome their self-censorship in a safe environment of their female peers, which enables a sense of trust and transparency.\n Women have the space to identify specific issues and personal/professional needs.\n Women develop a collaborative conversation and weave a support network.\n  She goes on to share that “as a result, once we [women] have addressed the psycho-sociological factors and established trust and belonging, with a bit of technique and ongoing practice and growing awareness, every woman can cultivate a voice that’s strong, clear, resonant and effective.” Marion goes deeper on the subject of gender-balanced leadership in her talk at TEDxStuttgart, using the age-old story of Goldilocks in a less traditional way.\nSo, we see there is an important alchemy in women-only spaces, like The Heroine’s Journey, for their ability to maximize individual transformation through gender-common group intention and action. That said, this newly generated energy and confidence must certainly not stay limited to the space between women.\nLike a roaring fire starts at the level of an ember, tended by a gentle and consistent source of air, female leadership can be sparked among female peers but must grow to illuminate all in a mix of environments and audiences.\nSo how did two women with rather unique coaching backgrounds decide to blend their passion and expertise in a three-day workshop?\n“When I first met Marion early in 2016 we talked for hours about our passions and strengths in the work we do. I knew Marion had a unique and powerful model that helps women cross that threshold and take centre stage with comfort. Our overlapping areas of interest around Presence meant that soon we were planning a joint retreat that exploits the power of our two modalities - being on the stage and being in the round pen.” Words by Evelyn McKelvie.\nI hear there are still a few places left. So, if this calls to you, or makes you think of a friend, manager or colleague who would benefit, you can find details and registration here. And, with TED 2018 in Vancouver coming up, I can just imagine the presentations brewing or in brainstorm phase that would flourish in this type of workshop.\n\"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman.\" - Melinda Gates.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"22434ca2b6eb9b8c647a1e6df7d0f43c","tags":["Women","Event","Retreat","Training","Canada"],"title":"Taking Female Leadership by the Reins","type":"news","url":"/news/2017/09/04/2017-09-04-taking-female-leadership-by-the-reins/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["Women","Entrepreneur","Event","Pitch","Paris"],"content":"It’s a simple fact that most successful startups are run by men. Why? Firstly, there are more men than women who decide - or dare - to start companies. Secondly, men are more successful at raising funds than women, and even those women who do raise funds end up raising less, on average, than their male counterparts. Having spent two years playing in the Silicon Valley arena myself, I’ve seen this truth first hand both in California and now in France. It’s a sad state of affairs, and it needs to change.\nEvents like Be a boss, happening this September 21st in Paris, aim to encourage women to start and run their own companies, and help them to succeed. At Ideas on Stage, we care deeply about redressing the gender balance, ensuring women have every opportunity to build their careers, and helping them to make and take these opportunities with both hands.\nSo, we’re very happy that for the third year running, Phil Waknell, our Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage, has been invited to deliver two keynotes at Be a boss, aiming to inspire the many female entrepreneurs to pitch themselves and their companies brilliantly, and help them to raise funds and attract clients. Given his experience helping literally hundreds of start-ups prepare and deliver powerful pitches that win contests and raise millions, I asked Phil about his thoughts on the matter.\n“Many of the best pitchers I’ve seen are women,” says Phil, who believes that in fact women have many advantages over men when it comes to pitching. “I find women generally spend more time preparing and thinking about what their audience needs, and more time rehearsing, whereas too many men have a tendency to ‘wing it’ and lean on their skills and charisma. That puts women at a great advantage, because preparation is the most important key to pitch success”.\nSo why do women raise funds less often than men? “Partly it’s because the investment community is still very male-dominated,” explains Phil, “and consciously or subconsciously that leads them to invest more easily in men. Plus, it’s a unfortunate fact of life that any minority needs to reach higher standards just to get an even chance, and among startup entrepreneurs women are still a very small minority. This is changing but there’s a long way to go, so women need to pitch at least as well as men, and ideally even better.”\nSo why is it that those women who make it over this barrier and convince investors still end up raising lower amounts than men? “I’ve heard this explained simply: women ask for less capital. Is this because of lower ambitions, lower expectations or lower self-confidence? I think they all play a part.”\nThat said, what does this mean for women looking to raise funds? “Like so much in life, it comes down to skills and attitude,” says Phil. “Learning how to create and deliver a fantastic pitch is vital for any entrepreneur, and building those skills will help women to build their self-confidence. As long as your startup is worth investing in and your business plan is credible, a powerful pitch delivered with a confident, positive attitude and a strong ambition will hook investors. And I truly believe that with this kind of pitch and attitude, a woman has a better chance of standing out than a man.”\nTo see Phil’s keynote and many other great speakers, sign up for Be a boss here - note that the event will be in French.\nIf you can’t make it to Be a boss, or you don’t speak French, why not sign up for our women-only course Women on Stage, led by Marion Chapsal, one of Europe’s leading specialists in gender-balanced leadership and coach to many top female executives.

For thousands of years, many of the most talented speakers could be found not in a shop or office but in a place of worship.\nAsk people which public speaker they most admire, and many will point to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. He spoke powerfully and inspired his audiences, and of the well-known speakers of the last century he was certainly among the best. Yet go to many Southern Baptist churches and you will find unknown preachers who speak with a similar style and no less power.\nReligion today in many Western communities in particular is facing a decline in congregations and a loss of interest among the young. It is all the more important for the heads of those congregations to be able to speak powerfully, to inspire their followers, and not only keep them coming back but to get them to bring their families and friends.\nTo be blunt, presentation skills are of the utmost importance for preachers, yet they are not always taught how to write or deliver a good sermon.\nThe Diocese of Toulouse, in the south of France, has decided it’s time to invest in their preachers’ presentation skills, so this October, Ideas on Stage will distill all of its expertise in storytelling, oratory and inspiration and take it to Toulouse for a workshop that promises to be very different from our usual sessions with startups, TED speakers and business executives, but just as important and impactful.\nSo, who teaches the preachers?
