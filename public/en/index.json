It’s rarely the best-known speakers who deliver the stand-out talks: it’s the best-prepared speakers.\nThis is where Ideas on Stage comes in. Since we assisted photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand with his memorable TED talk in 2009, we have helped over 300 TEDx speakers to create, prepare and deliver the talks of their lives. Curators across the world – from Montreal to Paris, from London to Washington DC – have trusted our professional storytelling experts, speaker coaches and designers to get the best out of their speakers.\nWhile most of our work is with major international corporations, helping senior executives with their most important presentations, our approach is to apply lessons from TED to the business world, rather than to apply business speaking basics to TED. So we’re not just your usual humdrum speaker coaches: we live and breathe TED every day, whether we’re working on a luxury product launch, a startup pitch or a TEDx talk.\nAnd since we love working with TEDx speakers and helping them spread their ideas, we do it for free - and in return we ask only to be listed with your other TEDx sponsors/partners. Of course our TEDx offers are subject to availability – it wouldn’t help you or anyone else if we tried to work on ten TEDx-es at once – but we usually find a way to help out if you give us enough advance notice.\nHere are the three levels of what we offer, starting with our free offer, and working all the way up to the full package which isn’t free, but offers a far greater contribution to your event.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"b092db44cd25bd5fe9cc92d77584dce6","tags":null,"title":"TEDx Coaching","type":"tedx","url":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" Train your teams to give TED-quality business presentations Presentations are everywhere in business, and most of them fail to reach their objectives - if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.\nThe Business Presentation Revolution, accompanied by the book of the same name, is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method. This course is taught in leading companies and forms part of the HEC Paris Executive MBA curriculum.\nThe course follows the four key steps of the Presentation SCORE method:\n Preparation - understanding your audience and their needs, setting your objective, and brainstorming to find your key messages Storytelling - shaping your messages into a compelling storyline that grabs and keeps the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and makes your key messages stick Visual Design - illustrating your talk with powerful visual aids that help your audience to understand and remember, instead of the typical death-by-bullet-point that only makes them switch off Speaking - preparing to speak, rehearsing, and delivering your presentation comfortably and convincingly.  The Business Presentation Revolution can be configured to meet your team\u0026rsquo;s needs, from a half-day introduction all the way up to the full three-day course where every participant prepares and delivers their own presentation and receives individual advice on how to improve even further. The longer the course, the more hands-on it will be.\nMany companies choose to combine The Business Presentation Revolution with some Public Speaking Coaching, giving each participant a few hours of one-on-one coaching after the course to help them apply and perfect the new methods.\nTo find out more about The Business Presentation Revolution and how it can help your teams to present more effectively, please fill in our contact form below.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"43f90f8645f23a679d37a780e3bd1896","tags":null,"title":"The Business Presentation Revolution","type":"training-workshops","url":"/training-workshops/business-presentation-revolution/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":" A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator.

Your document or presentation was received, but will it be read? Will it be remembered? And most importantly, will it be acted upon? Or, did you just waste your time \u0026hellip;\nEach year companies create millions of presentations and documents. Yet most of them are boring, hard to understand and lack a clear purpose. The information is there, but it doesn’t stick; and so, it is quickly forgotten.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Presentations and documents can be engaging, clear, and to the point. They are not doomed to slowly collect dust in the bottom of the receiver’s inbox. And because your competitors’ presentations are likely to be unappealing, it’s easy to get noticed! How? By combining reason and emotion.\nMaking the receiver hear your message is not enough. You have to catch their interest to make them want to listen. To achieve this, we will first arouse their natural curiosity.

Women, when they are speaking at the workplace, almost never get it “Just Right”. Some have advised women to be more assertive and to take on masculine attitudes. Others have suggested they should stick with their roles and act their more feminine attributes. In both cases, it doesn’t work. To quote the famous leading organization Catalyst for women and business, “women are damned if they do, doomed if they don’t”. This double-bind that women face every day has created a search for a way-out, a solution.\nWomen are still culturally trained to look for perfection, to seek for approval and acceptance, to ask permission to express themselves, to avoid failure at all costs, and to feel shame to go out and show how ambitious they can be. We are still very dependant on \u0026ldquo;what will people think of me ?\u0026rdquo; and we would do anything to avoid shame, criticism and judgement.\nIn Women on Stage we’ll explore a way to be heard, taken seriously, and given the authority to make change we so clearly see, without giving up on our femininity, and allowing us to express all the nuances of our emotions, personality and intelligence.\nDiscover the power of PRESENCE and develop your unique presence on stage.

You will also be asked to prepare a specific assignment, according to your profile and challenges.\nFacilitator Marion Chapsal, Ideas on Stage Chief Learning Officer\nMarion’s relentless quest is to coach women to find their voice, communicate with confidence and enthusiasm, and develop fully as 21st century women leaders. She has created Women on Stage because she believes that, still today, women’s voices are not fully heard, much less appreciated and acted upon and need more than ever to be taken into account and to have an impact to make the world a better place for all men and women.\nIn her unique coaching approach, Marion taps into theater techniques and gently encourages role playing, creating a safe and respectful environment where each participant feels free to express feelings, ideas, intuitions, take risks and pretend to be the change they want to see.\nMarion brings with her more than twenty years of executive training and coaching in Leadership and communication. She has taught Leadership at EM Lyon Business School and Cranfield School of Management. She’s a certified Master NLP coach, a rebirther and trained in Drama School and theater techniques. At 50, she went back to University to study a Master in Gender Studies, Sociology \u0026amp; linguistics, focusing on gender, speaking and power. It could have ended in a PhD; instead, she created Women on Stage.\n…and she also brings her huge collection of Comic Strips, animated movies and fairy tales characters, representing a very wide range of role-models and archetypes. The use of figurines is fantastic because it’s so easy, simple and fun!\nMarion is here to help women overcome their reluctance to shine in their lives and work, and recognize how incredibly brave and powerful they already are.\nTo organize a Women on Stage workshop for your company, or if you\u0026rsquo;d like to attend one of our public workshops, please contact us using the form below.

I have reasonable doubts that Santa does not really exist. So instead of writing a letter that I knew he would not answer I thought it was time to refresh the Ideas on Stage Brand, which hasn’t changed since the creation of the company in 2010.\nWe started with the font. We really love Gotham, the masterpiece from Tobias Frere-Jones. Its iconic design is built on a strong lineage of geometric sans serif fonts. It’s been used with great success by Obama’s campaign and on bags of crisps. We think it conveys the image of professionalism and reliability that we carry with us everywhere.\nNext was the logo. The original one drew some of its inspiration from an old Apple app for podcasts. But despite investing a significant number of minutes in its design it was definitely lacking subtlety and refinement. We tried many different ideas, some good, some “interesting”. In the end we decided we wanted to keep a link with our beginnings, and at the same time add subtle clues about who we are. The new logo has three circles. The big orange one represents the presence of the Speaker on stage. The small white circle is the head of the Speaker, the dot on the i of ideas, and the inner circle. The small orange circle breaks with the mold; it’s the outer circle, the one where the Speaker moves forward and connects with the audience.\nAfter working on the font and logo, I still had time to write a letter to Santa.

From Friday September 29th through Sunday evening on the 1st of October, Marion Chapsal and her co-facilitator Evelyn McKelvie will guide eight willing and ready women on a journey to find \u0026ndash; or fine-tune \u0026ndash; their public voice and take the stage alongside, you guessed it, horses. They call this workshop and retreat \u0026ldquo;The Heroine\u0026rsquo;s Journey\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Evelyn’s June article on “Slaying the Dragon of Fear”, it’s clear that she and Marion share a synergy in their coaching mission even though they come from opposite ends of the pond, as in Canada and France.\nExcuse me? Let me back up. Like Marion, Evelyn is a longtime Leadership Coach, working with Corporate Executives mainly through facilitating retreats. However, she is also the Founder of Equine Coach, an organization which “focuses on leadership development, mindfulness, and enhanced communication skills through working and playing with horses”.\nShe sees how spending hands-on time with horses is a transformational learning opportunity that connects people back to nature and their own intuitive emotional intelligence.\nIn Evelyn’s words: “Whether or not you are a corporate leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, an aspiring politician or activist, or a mom who wants to be a role model for her daughter”, being comfortable speaking with a microphone, being filmed or taking the stage in any way is key to building and flourishing in a career.\nMarion Chapsal, Chief Learning Officer and creator of Women on Stage, is also fully aware of this truth. Why? Because having worked with countless professionals including young female entrepreneurs to global political leaders, her life’s work is dedicated in many ways to nourishing and reinforcing women’s power and presence in their life and work, on or off-stage.\nWhen answering the question “Why women only workshops?” Marion answers:\n Women really get to speak! They\u0026rsquo;re less likely to be interrupted, and if they are, they will not remain silent as they might when interrupted by a man.\n Women more easily overcome their self-censorship in a safe environment of their female peers, which enables a sense of trust and transparency.\n Women have the space to identify specific issues and personal/professional needs.\n Women develop a collaborative conversation and weave a support network.\n  She goes on to share that “as a result, once we [women] have addressed the psycho-sociological factors and established trust and belonging, with a bit of technique and ongoing practice and growing awareness, every woman can cultivate a voice that’s strong, clear, resonant and effective.” Marion goes deeper on the subject of gender-balanced leadership in her talk at TEDxStuttgart, using the age-old story of Goldilocks in a less traditional way.\nSo, we see there is an important alchemy in women-only spaces, like The Heroine’s Journey, for their ability to maximize individual transformation through gender-common group intention and action. That said, this newly generated energy and confidence must certainly not stay limited to the space between women.\nLike a roaring fire starts at the level of an ember, tended by a gentle and consistent source of air, female leadership can be sparked among female peers but must grow to illuminate all in a mix of environments and audiences.\nSo how did two women with rather unique coaching backgrounds decide to blend their passion and expertise in a three-day workshop?\n“When I first met Marion early in 2016 we talked for hours about our passions and strengths in the work we do. I knew Marion had a unique and powerful model that helps women cross that threshold and take centre stage with comfort. Our overlapping areas of interest around Presence meant that soon we were planning a joint retreat that exploits the power of our two modalities - being on the stage and being in the round pen.” Words by Evelyn McKelvie.\nI hear there are still a few places left. So, if this calls to you, or makes you think of a friend, manager or colleague who would benefit, you can find details and registration here. And, with TED 2018 in Vancouver coming up, I can just imagine the presentations brewing or in brainstorm phase that would flourish in this type of workshop.\n\"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman.\" - Melinda Gates.\n","iconClass":"fa-pencil","objectID":"6ffcce75e32a068b52e9c919ab20827c","tags":["Women","Event","Retreat","Training","Canada"],"title":"Taking Female Leadership by the Reins","type":"news","url":"/news/2017/09/04/4.-taking-female-leadership-by-the-reins/"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","categories":["Women","Entrepreneur","Event","Pitch","Paris"],"content":"It’s a simple fact that most successful startups are run by men. Why? Firstly, there are more men than women who decide - or dare - to start companies. Secondly, men are more successful at raising funds than women, and even those women who do raise funds end up raising less, on average, than their male counterparts. Having spent two years playing in the Silicon Valley arena myself, I’ve seen this truth first hand both in California and now in France. It’s a sad state of affairs, and it needs to change.\nEvents like Be a boss, happening this September 21st in Paris, aim to encourage women to start and run their own companies, and help them to succeed. At Ideas on Stage, we care deeply about redressing the gender balance, ensuring women have every opportunity to build their careers, and helping them to make and take these opportunities with both hands.\nSo, we’re very happy that for the third year running, Phil Waknell, our Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage, has been invited to deliver two keynotes at Be a boss, aiming to inspire the many female entrepreneurs to pitch themselves and their companies brilliantly, and help them to raise funds and attract clients. Given his experience helping literally hundreds of start-ups prepare and deliver powerful pitches that win contests and raise millions, I asked Phil about his thoughts on the matter.\n“Many of the best pitchers I’ve seen are women,” says Phil, who believes that in fact women have many advantages over men when it comes to pitching. “I find women generally spend more time preparing and thinking about what their audience needs, and more time rehearsing, whereas too many men have a tendency to ‘wing it’ and lean on their skills and charisma. That puts women at a great advantage, because preparation is the most important key to pitch success”.\nSo why do women raise funds less often than men? “Partly it’s because the investment community is still very male-dominated,” explains Phil, “and consciously or subconsciously that leads them to invest more easily in men. Plus, it’s a unfortunate fact of life that any minority needs to reach higher standards just to get an even chance, and among startup entrepreneurs women are still a very small minority. This is changing but there’s a long way to go, so women need to pitch at least as well as men, and ideally even better.”\nSo why is it that those women who make it over this barrier and convince investors still end up raising lower amounts than men? “I’ve heard this explained simply: women ask for less capital. Is this because of lower ambitions, lower expectations or lower self-confidence? I think they all play a part.”\nThat said, what does this mean for women looking to raise funds? “Like so much in life, it comes down to skills and attitude,” says Phil. “Learning how to create and deliver a fantastic pitch is vital for any entrepreneur, and building those skills will help women to build their self-confidence. As long as your startup is worth investing in and your business plan is credible, a powerful pitch delivered with a confident, positive attitude and a strong ambition will hook investors. And I truly believe that with this kind of pitch and attitude, a woman has a better chance of standing out than a man.”\nTo see Phil’s keynote and many other great speakers, sign up for Be a boss here - note that the event will be in French.\nIf you can’t make it to Be a boss, or you don’t speak French, why not sign up for our women-only course Women on Stage, led by Marion Chapsal, one of Europe’s leading specialists in gender-balanced leadership and coach to many top female executives. She is also leading a power-packed women’s retreat and training, The Heroine’s Journey, this September 29-October 1 in beautiful British Columbia to empower women to find their voice and take the stage.\nBe a boss 2017 - links and information Event program: http://www.be-a-boss.com/programme-complet\nRegistration for Be a boss: http://www.be-a-boss.com/inscriptions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Beaboss2017/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Beaboss2017\nPrior to founding Ideas on Stage in 2010, Phil was manager at Procter \u0026amp; Gamble and commercial director at Hewlett-Packard.

The mission? To walk away with shareable resources and potential solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our world today—or is it already “tomorrow”?\n  Roundtable, Day 1 - Photo by Charles-Marie Boret‏ @cmboret Aug 28\n  As most of the Ideas on Stage team was away on vacation for some part of August, I had the luck of stepping into this project as one of my very first with the company. It was a privilege getting to work with the event’s Master of Ceremonies (MC), Alain Chauveau, as well as with four of the ten “TED style” expert presenters to support them in clarifying their core messages and structuring a 15-minute presentation that would leave the audience motivated and empowered.\nAmong the group were presenters Bruno Teboul, SVP Science \u0026amp; Innovation at Keyrus and author of Robotariat, Stéphan Aver, founder of Aaqius creators of the consumer-safe hydrogen canister STOR-H, Guillaume Marolleau, Head of Digital and Consumer Experience at Fleury Michon, and Joël Ruet, Chairman of The Bridge Tank.\nIt’s not the easiest for French professionals at this level to meet in August when most of France is on vacation, but each presenter made the time\u0026ndash;even if it meant taking a skype coaching call at midnight after a dinner in China just days before the event.\n  Brainstorming, Day 2 - Photo by Troisième Voix @3voixcom Aug 29\n  Now two months into working at Ideas on Stage, what stands out most is the level of quality, intelligence and heart of the organizations and individuals we get to interface with, including our team internally. An event like ACIDD is a perfect example of one such group of dedicated individuals who come together with a mission to send ripples of good out into the world, shaping our collective future toward global sustainability and well-being.\nTo learn more about the L’Université D’Été ACIDD and future events, head over to their official site or follow them on Facebook and Twitter @UECDD.

For thousands of years, many of the most talented speakers could be found not in a shop or office but in a place of worship.\nAsk people which public speaker they most admire, and many will point to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. He spoke powerfully and inspired his audiences, and of the well-known speakers of the last century he was certainly among the best. Yet go to many Southern Baptist churches and you will find unknown preachers who speak with a similar style and no less power.\nReligion today in many Western communities in particular is facing a decline in congregations and a loss of interest among the young. It is all the more important for the heads of those congregations to be able to speak powerfully, to inspire their followers, and not only keep them coming back but to get them to bring their families and friends.\nTo be blunt, presentation skills are of the utmost importance for preachers, yet they are not always taught how to write or deliver a good sermon.\nThe Diocese of Toulouse, in the south of France, has decided it’s time to invest in their preachers’ presentation skills, so this October, Ideas on Stage will distill all of its expertise in storytelling, oratory and inspiration and take it to Toulouse for a workshop that promises to be very different from our usual sessions with startups, TED speakers and business executives, but just as important and impactful.\nSo, who teaches the preachers?
