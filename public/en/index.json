Tech” (CMIT) (Tech Marketers’ Club). Since 2016, CMIT puts innovative B2B marketing startups in the spotlight and honors new talents. Each year, the winners are promoted on their website and their media partners. The objective is to give more visibility to the newcomers and highlight their services to their potential marketing clients. This year, three startups were selected: Kiliba, Omnilive and Sensego.\nThe three co-founders of the selected startups took part in the three-minute pitch contest. To shine on stage, they had all been prepared by the coaches of Ideas on Stage.\nKILIBA Kiliba is the first fully autonomous Email Marketing module using Artificial Intelligence. It was created to help marketers who are short of time, stop annoying users who are too solicited by marketing emails and reduce digital pollution by sending fewer emails.\n\u0026ldquo;The Ideas on Stage team was extraordinary! Very professional and available, she helped us structure our presentation to respect the 3 minutes time limit. Then, through a dedicated workshop, we discovered the tricks that professionals use for perfect delivery: tone of voice, choice of words, placement on stage, we worked on everything to be as perfect as possible and convince the jury! The result? We are very proud to have won the “GOLD” trophy! —Amaury de Larauze, cofounder of Kiliba\nOMNILIVE Omnilive is a patented automatic multi-camera video livestream solution. The individual journey of users can be tracked and analyzed to define finer audience analytics.\n\u0026ldquo;The biggest challenge of a presentation is to be short and focus on one message, and only one. The work with Vanessa from Ideas on stage allowed me to isolate the value proposition that best matched the CMIT audience. Talking on stage is an issue for an entrepreneur and although I’m quite comfortable, Frédéric at Ideas on Stage gave me tips that allowed me to really believe in myself.” — Cyril Zajak, cofounder of Omnilive\nSENSEGO Sensego is a predictive marketing solution. The startup helps companies in the tourism sector to claim back the digital relationship with their customers, using IA and smartphone signals to anticipate the moment when they will begin to prepare their holidays.\n\u0026ldquo;The coaching session with Frédéric-Pascal allowed me to understand the importance of putting oneself in the place of his audience, in order to be able to receive my messages at the same time that I send them. I think that this session will allow me not only to become a better presenter and seller, but also a better person. Moreover, it was very pleasant to work with Frédéric-Pascal.” — Teimour Daly, cofounder of Sensego\nIdeas on Stage helps leaders deliver powerful presentations, create inspiring events and empower their organizations with high quality public speaking coaching and training. Get in touch and we will help you create an outstanding event like we did for the MarTech Trophies.\n","description":"Discover how startups were prepared before the MarTech Trophies Ceremony by CMIT.","permalink":"/client-success-stories/martech-trophies-ceremony-by-cmit/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Events","Startups","Pitch"],"title":"MarTech Trophies Ceremony by CMIT"},{"author":"","contents":" TED - 2009 Every story needs a Hero. Ours was Yann Arthus-Bertrand, who we helped prepare for TED.\n TEDx - 2010 We coached speakers for TEDx events as soon as the program was created, starting with TEDxParisUniversités.\n   2011- Today TEDxLaDéfense. TEDxLille. TEDxMcGill. TEDxParis. TEDxSaclay. TEDxTours. TEDxWorldBankGroup. And many more.\n 300+ and counting We have coached more than 300 speakers for TEDx events. We built our international TEDx expertise with events in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and many countries in Europe. We have no plans to stop.\n  International TEDx expertise Producing a successful TEDx takes a lot of hard work in many different areas, but if everything is well-organised, what determines the success of the event is how well your speakers perform. It’s rarely the best-known speakers who deliver the stand-out talks: it’s the best-prepared speakers.\nThis is where Ideas on Stage comes in. Since we assisted photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand with his memorable TED talk in 2009, we have helped over 300 TEDx speakers to create, prepare and deliver the talks of their lives. Curators across the world – from Montreal to Paris, from London to Washington DC – have trusted our professional storytelling experts, speaker coaches and designers to get the best out of their speakers.\nWhile most of our work is with major international corporations, helping senior executives with their most important presentations, our approach is to apply lessons from TED to the business world, rather than to apply business speaking basics to TED. So we’re not just your usual humdrum speaker coaches: we live and breathe TED every day, whether we’re working on a luxury product launch, a startup pitch or a TEDx talk.\nAnd since we love working with TEDx speakers and helping them spread their ideas, we do it for free - and in return we ask only to be listed with your other TEDx sponsors/partners. Of course our TEDx offers are subject to availability – it wouldn’t help you or anyone else if we tried to work on ten TEDx-es at once – but we usually find a way to help out if you give us enough advance notice.\nHere are the three levels of what we offer, starting with our free offer, and working all the way up to the full package which isn’t free, but offers a far greater contribution to your event.\n   Service Free Pro Full     Provision of written and video materials to help speakers and organisers      Participation in final rehearsal (subject to availability and travel cost reimbursement)      Speaker preparation and coaching 2 Speakers     Slide design for speakers      Integrating slides and videos to ensure smooth running during the TEDx      Supervising the slides and videos during the TEDx to prevent and fix any technical problems       Bring your TEDx event to the next level  Contact us using the form below to see how we can help you make your TEDx a memorable day.\n All our services are available in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian, with native speakers of each language.\nBecome a TEDx Speaker Do you want to speak at a TED or TEDx event? Great! We recommend you find a local event and make contact with the organizers via their web site. We can help you to prepare and deliver a great talk, but it’s up to you to make the organizers want to have you on their stage. Please note that our role is to coach speakers for TEDx events - we are not the organizers, but we can help you find a TEDx or get selected.\nIf you’ve already been selected, tell the organizers about our special TEDx services, or contact us and see how we can help you to deliver the talk of your life.\n","description":"TEDx audiences have high expectations.

The event space was none other than the Grand Théâtre de Tours, a beautiful piece of architecture à l’italienne. This region is also home to world-famous sites such as the Clos Lucé, where Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years in France, the charming castles of Amboise, Blois, Chenonceau, Chambord and many more.\nTEDx Tours is so successful it sells out every year. So to learn more about how to make such a successful event, Pierre Morsa sat down with their curator, Fabien Boutard, to discuss the challenges of organizing a TEDx and how to find great speakers. Whether you want to create a TEDx or TED-inspired business event, we hope this sparks some new ideas for you!\nPierre: Fabien, it\u0026rsquo;s the fifth year in a row that you are the TEDx Tours curator. What drives you to organize these events?\nFabien: The story began five years ago in Tours on my couch on a summer night. I was watching a TEDx video and I said to myself: “It’s incredible that in a city with so many medical researchers, universities and so much intellectual potential, there is no way to communicate the results to the general public in a clear and simple way.” I then realized that the TEDx format was in fact perfect to showcase the bright ideas of our region and its inhabitants. It was also a way for me to satisfy my curiosity and find more inspiration.\nPierre: We know that it can be stressful. What advice would you give to other organizers to make things easier?\nFabien: TEDx events are organized by non-profit organizations, by teams entirely made of volunteers. The quality of the team is what really makes the difference. You’re often going to work for one year without knowing what the end result will be. To stay on track, each member has to know why he’s taking part in this adventure, what is his role and why it’s important. Then everything happens in the course of four hours. Months of work get rewarded, and it’s truly a magical moment! The other critical element is the quality of the speakers.\nPierre: Over the past years, you\u0026rsquo;ve found some great speakers that nobody knew. What is your secret?\nFabien: What we do is probably different from other events. We first list the ideas we would like to see on stage, then we find the best speakers we can find for each topic. We try to foresee what will be interesting in 1 year from now, not what is interesting today. With social networks, everything goes in and out of fashion incredibly quickly nowadays. Something that was on everyone’s mind may have become old news three months later; it already happened to us.\nPierre: How important is the preparation?\nFabien: No matter how famous your speaker is, the preparation phase is crucial. You should never compromise on the quality of the preparation. The best speakers spend between 30 and 50 hours writing, illustrating and practicing their talk. That may sound like a lot, but it is what it takes. The first step is to make sure the talk is going to be structured around a clear, key idea. Then there is a fairly long writing phase. Some prefer to write everything, others prefer to write the storyline only. It’s a fine balance between respecting what the speaker wants to say and making sure it’s going to be clear and impactful for the public. The last step is to practice, practice, practice until perfect.\nPierre: What advice would you give to people who want to be invited to give a TEDx talk?\nFabien: Why would your topic be of interest for the TEDx audience? We never select a personality or an ability to speak in public first: we always give more importance to the message that you want to communicate. It’s not necessary to send us a CV; having a message worth spreading is what counts.\nPierre: What do you think is the most important thing on D-Day?\nFabien: What we realized since the first edition, what worked, and sometimes didn’t, is when the audience experiences something greater than the sum of the talks. It then becomes a unique adventure, for the audience, for the speakers and for us. It’s our responsibility to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable and enjoyable evening, that the subtle alchemy between the various elements creates something unique and unforgettable.\nThank you very much, Fabien, for your inspiring tips to organize a great TEDx event!\n","description":"How to create a great TEDx event, with Fabien Boutard, curator of TEDx Tours","permalink":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/events/tedx-tours-2019/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Events","TEDx"],"title":"TEDx Tours 2019"},{"author":"","contents":"Train your teams to give TED-quality business presentations Presentations are everywhere in business, and most of them fail to reach their objectives - if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.\nThe Business Presentation Revolution, accompanied by the book of the same name, is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method. This course is taught in leading companies and forms part of the HEC Paris Executive MBA curriculum.\nThe course follows the four key steps of the Presentation SCORE method:\n Preparation - understanding your audience and their needs, setting your objective, and brainstorming to find your key messages Storytelling - shaping your messages into a compelling storyline that grabs and keeps the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention and makes your key messages stick Visual Design - illustrating your talk with powerful visual aids that help your audience to understand and remember, instead of the typical death-by-bullet-point that only makes them switch off Speaking - preparing to speak, rehearsing, and delivering your presentation comfortably and convincingly.  The Business Presentation Revolution can be configured to meet your team\u0026rsquo;s needs, from a half-day introduction all the way up to the full three-day course where every participant prepares and delivers their own presentation and receives individual advice on how to improve even further. The longer the course, the more hands-on it will be.\nMany companies choose to combine The Business Presentation Revolution with some Public Speaking Coaching, giving each participant a few hours of one-on-one coaching after the course to help them apply and perfect the new methods.\nTo find out more about The Business Presentation Revolution and how it can help your teams to present more effectively, please fill in our contact form below.\n","description":"Thanks to our signature training course, your team's presentations will never be the same again.","permalink":"/presentations-training/the-business-presentation-revolution/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"The Business Presentation Revolution Training"},{"author":"","contents":"About the author Marine Bénard is event coordinator and project manager at Ideas on Stage, a company specializing in presentations and corporate events. Previously, she worked for event agencies and an international exhibition company, and helped organize several high-profile events. She turns business conferences and meetings into dynamic, memorable events, working with organizers and senior management to develop agendas, set up the logistical aspects and prepare speakers that make a lasting impact.\nIdeas on Stage is not an event agency and we are not just coordinators. We are specialists in powerful business presentations and events. We work with clients all over the world to present their ideas and strategies clearly and memorably. We design the event with you every step of the way: advice, reflection that leads to creativity, logistics and set-up.\nAs we do for our training and coaching, we apply our brainstorming, storytelling and design methods to Event Management. This methodology will help us understand together who are your attendees/guests, their needs, the context of this event and your objectives.\nThen, project management steps in. We will organize and control the entire implementation of the various artistic, material, human, regulatory and budgetary elements, and ensure overall consistency, while sticking to the planning. We will ensure that your corporate event is not only memorable for the attendees, but also achieves your goals in alignment with your organizational culture.\nSet the Goals When? Where? Why? What? Who? Answering all of these questions will help you set strategic goals while determining the content of your event. Wanting to organize an event is good. But knowing why, and creating an event with a clear purpose is much better! In any project, foundations are essential. One of the most frequent mistakes is to forget to define the expected framework and objectives. It inevitably leads to oversights and a lower return on investment. To avoid that mistake, start by defining the frame with the 5 W rule:\nWHAT? What type of event do you want to organize? Is it internal or external? Is the atmosphere festive, relaxed, professional?\nWHO? Who is the target?\n=\u0026gt; Employees, prospects, customers, suppliers, investors, press, general public, VIP…?  WHY? What is the strategic goal?\n Notoriety, brand image, visibility, team building, loyalty…?  Why do you want to organize this event?\n Motivate your employees, develop the corporate culture, make an announcement/inform, launch a new product, educate customers/prospects about a product or service, find new partners, present something new to the press…?  What messages do you want to convey to your guests? What will they discover or learn?\nWHERE? Where will it be held?\n Conference room, restaurant, office…?  What is the chosen geographic area? What type of place are you looking for?\n Atypical, cozy, warm…?  WHEN? When should it take place?\n Morning, lunch, afternoon, dinner, evening?  How long will it last?\n A few hours, half a day, a day?  What day of the week?\nIs the event the fastest, easiest and most relevant way to get your message across to your target audience? What added value can be expected from the organization of this event compared to simply sending a report, a brochure? Ultimately, is this THE solution to achieve the objectives set by your company? These are some of the key questions to ask yourself before you get started.\nUsing the 5 W, you will identify several important elements: the theme of the event, the subjects addressed, the speakers selected, the budget required, the tone of the invitations, the decoration and the scenography, etc. Don’t fall in love with an idea, no matter how extraordinary it may seem. Remember that an event only exists if it meets the expectations of the audience!\nUse S.M.A.R.T. Objectives  Specific. They are clear, understandable and as precise as possible, even out of context. Measurable. They are precisely defined and allow you to track your progress and assess the result. Achievable. They must be ambitious enough to represent a challenge and boost motivation and concentration towards their achievement but without discouraging your team from reaching them. Relevant. The objectives of your event must be part of a global business strategy. Ask yourself if your event helps you meet the challenges of your business. And take your resources into consideration (human, financial, material, time); your goal should be consistent with your situation. Time bound. You need to set a date to reach your goals. Do not hesitate to break down a main objective into several steps, which can correspond to given periods (a month for example).  The type of event you choose, in line with your objectives, will determine the number of participants you want. The next questions will therefore be about the presence or absence of accompanying persons (spouses, children), whether or not to use facilitators and speakers, and whether or not you want to invite journalists to your event.\nTo choose the date, remember to check the legal school holidays, competing events, public holidays, periods identified as busy depending on the sector of activity, or even the electoral calendar.\nThe location should be easy to reach for your participants. Choosing a location that is too far from any transport infrastructure, too small or too large, is guaranteed to annoy and discourage your visitors. Beyond the content, the location should leave a strong impression on your participants. Either the destination matches a strategic decision of the company (presence of a branch of the company, subcontractors, desire to develop in the region), or you have the freedom to choose. In the latter case, we advise you to select several options as part of a pre-selection and to measure the pros and cons of each of them, before making a final choice.\nThe duration of the event is defined by what you have to say and show. If there are a lot of topics to discuss, do not hesitate to plan your event over several days so that the speakers can present and debate in good conditions.\nFinally, do not choose the theme of your event lightly. The theme will be the unifying thread for your communications and for the promotion of your event. Above all, it allows you to convey the purpose of your event in an original way and ensures that all your guests gather around a common idea.\nOrganize and Set Up Management Tools A keyword: anticipation! Any event is the result of a set of tasks, providers and suppliers, to-do lists, tracking spreadsheets. The link between all: a master organization! To keep everything going as smoothly as possible and to anticipate each action, here are five essential tools.\nRetroplanning You will certainly not be able to remember everything. This document details each step leading to D-Day. It contains all the tasks and sub-tasks necessary for the completion of the project, classified in order of priority. Each task is assigned to one or more managers, with clear deadlines and status (to do, in progress, done, late). You will also have an overview of the people mobilized for a better distribution of the tasks.\nYou are free to choose the tool that suits you best. The larger and more complex the event, the more robust the tracking tool will need to be.\nA Checklist of Things to Have on D-Day This list will be essential on the day of the event. It will be completed one task after another, throughout the organization. This can be for example “Order xx vegetarian meals” or “Don’t put the chairs, tables, etc on stage before 10 a.m.” This list clears your mind and keeps you from constantly asking yourself if you’ve forgotten anything.\nA Technical Timeline The closer you get to the date of the event, the clearer the event will materialize in your mind and you will be able to program everything, minute by minute. This timeline is the equivalent of a film script. It precisely lists every action that needs to be done, when, where and by whom. It is the reference for the day so that the experience is as smooth as possible.\nChoose the tool that suits you best. Excel is a very popular tool for this.\nYour Team Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do. Share your planning with everyone and make a general briefing. Explain to each team member his/her responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings and moments of hesitation on D-Day.\nGeneral Rehearsal Before the big day, imagine yourself in the shoes of your guests. Step by step, experience the event. This will give you the opportunity to compare reality with what is on paper. This is also where you will be able to do technical tests and verify that everything is working according to plan. Ask yourself at each step: “What if?” Considering the worst allows you to eliminate the unexpected and prepare for the best.\nDefine and Manage the Budget The size of your event is largely determined by your budget. How much is your total budget? Is the budget strictly capped or can you plan your event first and then see how much it will cost? How much should you allocate to each element? And what if you exceed it?\nThere are many expense items: venue rental, reception and security staff, caterers, audiovisual equipment, furniture, insurance, etc. It’s up to you to quantify what you can hire for this event. Do you have other sources of funding (grants, sponsors, etc.)? Do you charge your participants? What are the possible sources of external revenue? Should the event be profitable or just balanced? Again, answering these questions will guide you in your management.\nThere’s never enough budget when running an event. That’s why it’s critical to prioritize your objectives and commit only to what is realistic. To stay on track and make sure you allocate your financial resources optimally, here are some tips:\n Create a first event budget with estimated figures to help you calculate the required budget, income targets, and break-even point of your event. To plan your budget, you can simply create a table and register your expenses and revenues. There are also several specific applications for calculating and managing the budget. Update your estimates with the actual figures as soon as budget items have been confirmed and committed to so that you can rework your budget allocation if needed. Keep a safety margin, essential for unforeseen expenses.  Find the right place This is a key success factor for your event. Once you have defined your budget, you have an idea of the number of guests and the kind of venue you can afford. You can then start looking for the best location possible. Here are some criteria to choose THE ideal location for your event.\nRelevance The location of your event contributes to the image you want to convey. The overall atmosphere should reflect your brand image and represent your objectives. Study as many options as possible and carefully weigh the pros and cons of each. The more the place will differ from the atmosphere you want to create, the more you will have to compensate with additional decoration. If all or part of your event is outdoors, consider your alternatives if it starts raining, and choose a date that minimizes the risk of rain.\nProximity and accessibility The location of the place is critical to the success of your event. Make sure that it is easily accessible and that its position is relatively central for your attendees. Check if there are enough parking spots. If your guests are traveling from abroad, then select a location near an airport and take into account accessibility by public transport.\nCapacity The space must be proportionate to the number of expected attendees. Make sure that the space does not appear empty because it’s too big, or that the guests are not able to move because it’s too small. Plan for extra space needed to support the event (i.e. coat room, registration, prep room, etc.)\nOriginality Nothing better to make an impression than selecting an outstanding location. An unusual place will leave a positive image and an unforgettable memory to your guests!\nOnce you shortlist the locations that meet your constraints and expectations, do not hesitate to contact them and ask questions:\n What is the price for the rental, including the days/hours of set-up/clean-up? What is the maximum number of guests? What are the terms of cancellation? Is there a caterer referenced/imposed or do you have to plan for it yourself? What are the audiovisual possibilities on the site? What about the power supply? Is it possible to play music? Is parking paid or free? Are there shuttle and taxi services? What can the place provide, and what should you take care of yourself? Is there a cleaning staff? Security staff?  Go to the place and make a detailed visit: from the parking to the reception hall and from the event spaces to the sanitary facilities. This visit may give you negotiating arguments before you sign the contract.\nChoose Your Providers Several providers will be required, depending on the configuration and size of your event. Here are some rules for finding the best providers:\n Seek recommendations within your professional circle. This at least gives you evidence of the provider’s quality. Once you find a service provider you are satisfied with, you can start building a long-term relationship with him. Build a database of contacts: company, contact, website, recommendations, details of the offer, prices, availability, etc. Always ask for a quote detailing the costs line by line. You can then simply integrate it and adapt it to your budget. Do not consider any price quote as fixed. To optimize your management, do not hesitate to negotiate with the service provider or put several companies into competition.  Make Your Event Unforgettable A great event creates emotion. It pleases, surprises, amazes, makes people laugh… To achieve this, every detail counts: the decoration/layout of the building, the quality of the presentations of your speakers, the animations, the master of ceremony, …\nHow to Properly Prepare the Venue The venue and its decoration can make a huge impression on your guests. It will reflect your company’s image. Whether it’s for a conference, a trade fair, an internal meeting or a product launch, be creative. Create a universe linked to the message and main theme of your event. Internet is a nearly infinite source of ideas and inspiration. The scenography decorators are also at your service to create the atmosphere you want by adapting it to the constraints of the venue. They will help you enhance your brand’s presence.\nIt is advisable to arrange and decorate in priority the spaces that will draw the largest crowd and attention:\n reception desk/entrance buffet the stage, for a conference the booths, at a trade show  These spaces will also be the most photographed/filmed. Make sure that photographs will have a convenient location to shoot from. Use colors, lights, sounds and volumes to design an amazing space that looks good on film.\nA successful conference cannot happen without a successful technical execution:\n The stage is slightly raised so that the whole audience can see the speaker. It will also be large enough for the speaker to move from left to right without constraints, and to accommodate groups if necessary (such as a panel). Arrange for the audience to be in the shade, but not completely in the dark. This allows to film audience reactions if video teams are present. Good stage lighting will greatly improve the chance of having quality photos and videos. Provide a small bottle of room-temperature water on a desk so that the speaker can drink. During formal presentations, the speaker often stands behind a podium. Aside from these very formal cases, we do not recommend its use, as it adds a barrier between the speaker and the audience. Check where the speakers are entering and leaving the stage. In the case of a seated audience, make sure that all guests have a seat. Check all audiovisual equipment (screen, slide format, secondary video screens, timer, microphones, clicker with batteries, sound systems, connection cables to connect the computer to the projection system, etc.).  How to select the speakers Speakers will also be a very important and meaningful way to make an impression. In many ways, your speakers, especially big name speakers, will be the “face” of the event and help you attract guests.\nChoose speakers who match your vision of the event and enrich the conversation. They can be opinion leaders who will attract participants, experts who master the subject or theme perfectly and will improve the quality of the debate, or enthusiasts who will offer an alternative vision to participants.\nDo not forget your professional network when looking for these speakers. Searching into your network has the advantage of providing a warmer introduction to a potential contact. It can also help reduce costs if they agree to join your event for free.\nHow to Choose Activities Organizing an unforgettable event undoubtedly means fun activities that will engage your guests and make them have a good time. This has several advantages:\n Impress your guests Create a friendly environment Promote exchanges between participants Attract people Generate posts on social networks  During a business event, whatever the objectives, you will have to think about activities that will make your guests comfortable, immerse them in a relaxing atmosphere where they can have fun while receiving the message you want to communicate.\nParticipatory games or group games, such as games using LEGO, are excellent animations for the purpose of a challenge. High-tech events are very trendy and offer immersive and fun experiences. The unusual entertainment offers your guests the opportunity to do an activity that they would never have been able to do elsewhere. In any case, we can help you find the best ideas to animate your event.\nCreate an Effective Communication Plan Everything is organized. Now you just have to start the communication and make your guests want to register! No successful event can exist without successful communication.\nIf time permits, plan for “multi-channel” communication. This maximizes your chances of reaching your target. The better you know your intended audience, the better you will be able to communicate effectively. This will allow you to adapt the tone and style you use to “speak” to your target.\nCommunicate Before the Event Website. Today, an event should have a website. Depending on the time and budget you have, there may be a question of a dedicated site with a specific domain name, a page on your existing corporate site, or a simple banner at the top of your site. Make your site attractive and clearly state the place, date and theme. Do not forget to integrate a button for the registration of your participants. If speakers are present at your event, give them a good place, with photo, text and biographies.\nLanding page. It’s the page that a visitor lands on after clicking on an advertisement or a call-to-action button on your website or social media. It allows you to highlight the most important information, notify participants of the various news related to your event or to send a reminder to those who have not confirmed their registration.\nNewsletter. It is a good way to maintain the relationship with your contacts, by quickly sharing free news and by showcasing new products or services. Qualify your contact database properly.\nInvitations. It’s up to you to choose between paper and electronic formats. Send a “save the date” notice to your guests so that everyone can block the date and organize in advance. Resend an email just before the end of the official registration date. Just before the event, send a new reminder with all the relevant information.\nSocial media. The choice of social media to activate will depend on your target audience. Take into account the specifics of each media. Invent a short, simple and fun hashtag for your event and use it as soon as possible. Send as many tweets as you can. Post your event on Facebook and LinkedIn, add a logo or image and don’t forget to link to your event page. Regardless of the media used, be sure to provide relevant, synthetic and interesting information every time. And entice your audience to share and repost your content to their audience.\nPartnerships \u0026amp; influencers. Some organizations would probably be delighted to help you and associate their name with your event. Try to reach agreements with suppliers who can bring something, either by promoting your event through their channels, or by providing D-Day services or products. Also look for bloggers, YouTube stars, Instagram icons… They are called “influencers.” If they are ready to associate their name with your event, your visibility will be greatly increased.\nPress and media. If you have time and it is suitable to your event, prepare a press release and a press kit to send to a selection of media.\nEvent marketing assets also include teaser emails, mobile event app, designed posters, flyers, pin badges and other accessories to keep the event front-of-mind.\nCommunicate on D-day On D-Day, communication meets a triple objective:\n Create engagement among your audience. Invite your guests to share your event and its highlights. What could be better than a live broadcast of their messages posted live on the media? Your guests will certainly feel the need to contribute! Give external visibility. You develop your notoriety and at the same time allow all those who could not be present to benefit from the content. Be active on social media platforms, live, via photos, videos and quotes. Create as much content as possible. Share photos, film the event, interview participants and speakers. This content will then be shared on media and on your website.  Other elements are also possible to make your event attractive and interactive: quizzes and draws to win prizes; surveys to give a voice to the audience but also collect feedback on your event.\nCreate Engagement People expect more from their conference and event experience than ever before. If a corporate event cannot generate engagement, it will impact the attendees’ ability to retain information. The week before your event is crucial for building this engagement. Here are some simple tips to do so.\nProduce Great Content A memorable event starts with engaging content. The content you deliver should support the strategic objective of your event as well as audience interests and needs. Share behind-the-scene photos, speaker quotes and moments to make attendees really feel like part of the experience. Ensure that your event speakers and presentations are relevant.\nLive posting on social media during your event is an excellent way to keep your attendees engaged. Give attendees the possibility to access the agenda, speakers bios, maps and more to prepare for the event in advance.\nUse Gamification Make your event fun and enjoyable. Add competitions or games to spice up the event. Insert surprises, such as musicians, professional acrobats or magicians. Incorporate virtual or augmented reality into your training session. Organize a raffle and announce the winners in between event sessions. Whatever entertainment element you choose, your attendees will appreciate a fun break in a packed day.\nOrganize a live Question \u0026amp; Answer Session and Polling When it comes to the Q\u0026amp;A sessions, traditional methods are often met with groans and eye rolling. Today’s event technology makes it much easier to interact with your guests. Make use of a dedicated tool to enhance and improve communication. Consider collecting and curating top attendee questions and answers. Collect audience feedback on your event. By listening and interacting, you increase attendee engagement as well as identify opportunities to improve the overall experience.\nCreate Networking Opportunities For many, networking is the primary reason for attending an event. By creating networking opportunities—whether face-to-face or virtual, one-on-one or in groups—you can encourage and facilitate networking and create a more valuable experience for attendees.\nCreate a Meeting Place With Your Partners and Sponsors If you have sponsors and partners for your event, then those paying customers will be looking for real connections with attendees, rather than just signage. They should also have the best seats.\nAdapt the Seating Layouts Conventional seating layouts still work best for some sessions, but there are other options which can improve engagement. Different layouts serve different purposes, so consider the objectives and best approach for each session.\nCreate an Event Hashtag Before your event takes place, create a short and unique hashtag that will be used across your event. Have all your event speakers use of the hashtag. Add the hashtag to speaker slides, event signage, badges, and any place your audience will go for information.\nCreate a Mobile App Mobile apps are now commonplace for organizers and attendees, but remain an effective way to improve audience engagement. A well-designed event app enables attendees to plan their itinerary at the event, receive alerts for essential information, connect with other attendees, and find answers to common questions.\nConference engagement is a challenge but is not impossible. Using the right event technology tools, implementing feedback strategies, reconciling goals and expectations, and staying authentic should be the top priorities.\nPrepare and Print Event Materials What is the key to successful event materials? It needs to be professional, easily recognizable and brand consistent. When you use the same logos, fonts, colors … over and over again, customers easily recognize your brand and easily remember your business. Here are 5 key points to organize and create successful event materials:\nList every promotional material you will need for your event. It’s easy to think about some key items like business cards and brochures, but don’t forget the little items such as signs, name badges, goodies, or the pre-event material as well (invitations and “save the date”).\nDetermine the size of each item. For each item, write down the dimensions required and make sure your designers have the information. Be sure you give them as much detailed information as possible. Your project will avoid delays and frustration.\nUse templates for print materials if possible. Using templates helps to keep your design consistent. Make sure it is accessible to your designers.\nDefine the quantities you need. You will likely bring several different types of materials to your event, but you may not need to bring the same quantity of each. Keep in mind that for some items, such as signs, it may be a good idea to have an extra sign printed up just in case one is damaged or lost in transit.\nCreate a timeline and set deadlines. Your deadlines are going to determine the timeline for the entire project. The first step is to gather all deadlines from your vendors and printers. Then, create a timeline for your team/designers that allows buffer time to absorb inevitable hiccups. Finally, work backward to create your production timeline.\nD-Day After weeks, even months of preparation, the big day has arrived! How to avoid getting lost among the multitude of things to manage that day? How is it possible not to forget anything? How to make sure that everything goes smoothly? Here are the golden rules for perfect execution:\n The day before, prepare everything you can and prepare for the worst. Scroll through the event planning in your head to review each step and consider all possibilities. A sentence should loop in your head: “What if…?”. This brings to light elements that you could never have anticipated around a meeting table. Install clear signage so that each person can find the site and rooms easily. Review accessibility and safety concerns. Book a significant time slot for rehearsals, set-up, etc. On the day of the event, arrive early! You’ll find time flies twice as fast as usual. Ensure that all technical equipment works properly (microphones, sound system, video projector, camera, computer, connections, lights, wifi if necessary, etc.). Have backup batteries for your electronic devices. All of them. Check that the cleaning has been done. Make sure that the deliveries have arrived (equipment, goodies, documentation, etc.). Print all the documents you will need (detailed briefs for service providers, checklist of “essentials,” technical timeline, flyers, programs, etc.). Build a “logistics kit” with Scotch tape, sheets of paper, pens, markers, cleaning products, trash bags … and everything that might be useful to you, as well as a first aid kit, in case: plaster, bandages, scissors, etc. Brief each team member. If you want to ensure smooth execution, make sure everyone knows from the start what is expected of them. Organize a briefing, in which everything is clearly and precisely indicated. If necessary, provide a copy of the technical timeline of the event with all relevant contacts. Keep with you the documents created throughout the organization. Make sure that the welcoming process for your participants is fluid and efficient. Look everywhere, all the time. Pay attention to the smallest details. Are some buffet trays empty? Did a poster come off? Is a table wobbly? Respect the timing. You are free to designate a “time keeper” among the members of your team who will be responsible for the schedule. Announce the program during the event, and stick to it. Your guests will appreciate having a clear view of the process. Be transparent with your audience or with your teams or service providers. A speaker is late? Do you have a technical problem? Explain it clearly. It is always unpleasant to experience an unforeseen event or to undergo a last-minute modification without understanding what is going on. Be discreet but available. You will be extremely busy, try to be available in case there is a need for you. If it could not be anticipated, accept the unexpected. It’s part of the event … anything can happen. Act professionally whatever happens, rely on your team and control your emotions. And tell yourself that this is one more lesson to learn for the next event!  After the Event It’s over, the door just closed behind the last guest. You feel a mixture of relief, pride, fatigue…. But now is not the time to release all the pressure. The hardest part is over but save some energy for the final stretch: the post-event phase. Take time to evaluate and close your event:\nFollow-up. Make sure to pay any outstanding bills and follow-up with reimbursements as needed for staff. If you encountered problems, be sure to follow up with those involved and resolve these issues. Save an electronic record of what you did, so those that plan the event in the future will know what you did, save time, and can learn from your challenges.\nThank. Partners, participants, speakers, service providers, various helpers, … take the time to thank each of them.\nShare. Do not hesitate to send to stakeholders all useful and quality content, such as photos or videos of the event, interviews, … to further extend your event. This can be done by email, via your website or social media. You can also send a report: it’s a good way to receive feedback from your guests if you didn’t already have one.\nAsk. Involve your participants through polls or satisfaction surveys right after the event. Plan closed questions (general appreciation of the event, of the providers, of the program, etc.) and open questions. This will lead to improvement or real positive points.\nEvaluate your providers. Follow up on your collaboration with them, in order to capitalize on the best over the long term.\nAnalyze. Take the time to consider the impact and ROI of your event, in relation to your objectives. It is not because everyone had fun that the event is a success. And the reverse is also true. In particular, calculate the absenteeism rate and assess your budget. Integrate these figures and results into a clear report and share it with everyone involved in organizing your event. Also discuss all the pros and cons of the event place, the different services provided. These are valuable indications for an upcoming event, but also for suppliers and partners.\nAn event represents such an investment, in terms of time and budget, that it would be a shame not to make the most of it. Continue creating content and share it: articles from your video interviews, videos from the film of the event, quotes from your speakers, photos of the event, articles in the press, etc. This will further help increase awareness of your business.\nConclusion Organizing events has no more secrets for you! You now have all the keys to create a quality, memorable and unique event. However, you will understand that preparing for an event requires a lot of involvement and this time can sometimes be difficult to find between the different daily tasks. This is why Ideas on Stage is a major event player who will support you in this organization and relieve your workload.\n","description":"The keys to organize a successful business event.

Confidence. Leadership. In this professional development training participants will learn the fundamentals of what makes a successful presentation while addressing the specific challenges women face when speaking up.\nWomen on Stage was created for those who wish to:\n Feel more free when presenting (disavowed of judgement and expectations) Feel more at ease in the body when expressing oneself (or when publicly visible) Level-up leadership presence and visibility (coherence, connection and self-confidence)  Across one or two days (depending on group request), we will offer participants Ideas on Stage presentation techniques along with personalized coaching in a supportive group environment. We find participants grow even faster when in a small group due to the benefits of sharing with peers and witnessing others’ breakthroughs. Practicing, even with a small public, helps us to overcome public speaking nerves, to face fears of judgement or failure and take safe risks. This is what ultimately builds the confidence to speak successfully when opportunity arises.\nOriginally brought to life by Marion Chapsal, today Women on Stage “goes 2.0” with two new torchbearers: Rose Bloomfield and Frédéric-Pascal Stein. Life is not a women’s only club. Which is why we have created a balanced work space with both male and female facilitation of an agenda rich with discussion and hands-on exercises that will raise awareness and develop speaking skills. Rose and Frédéric-Pascal provide a dynamic blend of professional experience and communication expertise allowing them to adapt to the needs and level of each group.\nWhy Women on Stage? The beginning of the 21st century was marked by an explosion of female power in both the social and professional world. Equal rights, equal pay, gender respective terminology, the #metoo movement, scientific articles, international headlines featuring female leaders and entrepreneurs … the whole world is calling women into the light. Now more than ever is the time to proudly take the stage and share your inspiring stories and voice with the world.\nToday, the notion that women are “equal to men” is news to no one. What may be newsworthy, however, is society’s shift of perception that being a woman is not just an equivalent to something male, but that being female is an essential half to the whole, a powerful role and strength.\nThe world is changing fast. Global awareness may be shifting towards balance, but in many ways we still fall prey to old habits and miss opportunities to act in alignment with the new paradigm. To effectively update our behavior and communication, it is important to step back, bring our head above water, consult our inner council, build a supportive network, exchange and learn from the community and intentionally build a more balanced future together.\nWe have a choice: wait another decade or more for our words and actions to slowly catch up, or … Women on Stage 2.0.\nChallenges Women Face Have you felt cut off when speaking in a meeting? Have you felt caught in the double bind of how to act as a leader? Have you struggled with trusting your voice to rally engagement and buy-in?\nToo many strong, accomplished, top-tier professional women are still struggling to be heard. Too many women still hesitate before sharing their point of view, feeling their throat tighten and breath shorten in the same moment they would otherwise speak. And too many women don’t act, or make the intuitive decision, dress authentically, or express themselves freely for fear of being criticised—or worse, dismissed. But why?\n There is the famous double-bind theory, which proposes that in a dominantly male work world women feel trapped by others’ judgement of being too “feminine” (read: nice, approving, meek) or too “masculine” (read: bossy, opinionated, outspoken). There is also the issue that the higher women grow in their career, the less they see of their female peers in the board room; we all know it is often harder to speak up as a minority. There are also the studies and statistics that show the rate of interrupting women is significantly higher than interruption of male counterparts. Not to mention, demotivating factors such as wage disparities, the difficulty of balancing motherhood and personal balance with professional aspirations, gender biases and the list varies for each woman and culture.  This workshop is not built upon the idea that women are victims, but we do believe that we must begin with awareness of the challenges and blocks we face so we can move through acceptance and into fulfilling, liberating, fruitful balance. To go deeper, join the discussion.\n“Women on Stage 2.0 is your personal accelerator program to become more visible, present and free.”\nWhy take the workshop?  To prepare to speak at a conference Recently promoted to a higher level of management Want to change presentation culture at your company Make a difference in the world through using your voice Share your personal story on stage or for TEDx Practice facing fears and overcoming public speaking stress  Workshop Overview  Open: introduction and intention setting in circle Learn: presentation on sociocultural context for women and public speaking tools Discuss: timed group discourse on why we use our voice and sometimes don’t Create: intuitive collaging exercise to envision our empowered self Break bread: a lovely Parisian lunch together Present: individual presentations practicing new techniques Listen: group witness and constructive feedback Coach: receive personalized coaching on your voice, body and messages Close: circle-up to share takeaways and intentions moving forward  In the one- or two-day training, we will begin by connecting in an open circle where we move from the default analytical, monkey-mind consciousness and communication mode into our hearts, intuition and bodies. From there we set intentions, share a few areas we wish to focus on and create the space for personal growth and professional development.\nThen, the facilitators will present an overview of the socio-cultural context for women in public speaking today, noting some historical leaps and bounds made on the global stage, and inspiration for where women seem to be heading. Next we’ll share the essential tools for building a successful professional presentation. *In the two-day training, we can go into greater depth based on group needs around preparation, objective setting, key messages and delivery with more individual coaching.\nThrough mindfulness and physical warm-up exercises, women will learn how to feel more relaxed in their body while expressing themselves with power; meaning, from a place of truth, conviction and clarity. We will practice standing literally balanced in our center, feet planted and connected to the ground, breathing and speaking from our diaphragm and then trusting what comes out from there.\nIn addition, before the workshop is through, we will have explored our visions for a more empowered self, identified our current strengths as leaders as well as a couple areas for growth, “taken the stage” applying new tools to individual presentations, given and received feedback from the group as well as your coaches and ultimately practiced speaking up through the blocks and into boldness.\nThis training is not only a lever of change for participants, but we believe is equally transformative for those around them, men and women alike. Women on Stage 2.0 is an accelerator for cultivating personal confidence and clarity when presenting in public as well as being a stand for balance in the professional environment. It is an investment in changing the way the world at large, starting at the office, sees and values women—of course, starting with how we see and value ourselves.\nKey Takeaways  Methodology to successfully prepare a presentation Tips on natural gesturing, posture How to overcome stress and nerves when speaking in public Suggestions for developing your voice and presence How to set a transformational objective for your presentation How to structure a presentation with key messages Understand how to connect more with yourself and audience while speaking Develop leadership presence Explore feminine power and in a safe space Leave inspired by yours and others’ stories and accomplishments  The Team   Rose Bloomfield  Rose Bloomfield is a professional public speaker, Master of Ceremonies and presentation coach.

This is an internal competition where all MBA students are invited to participate.\nMore than the cash prizes, teams are mentored through the process by experts in launching businesses, investors, and management consultants. Teams gain world class advice and guidance towards launching their start-up businesses.\nServing as one of the mentors is where we come in. When we were approached by INSEAD to become involved, we quickly said yes. We believe in supporting entrepreneurs who are using their knowledge, skills, and creativity to change the world in a positive way. Having coached hundreds of start-ups over the last decade, we bring our communication and pitch expertise to the table.\nWe begin by giving a webinar to all the semi-finalist teams. During this webinar we share our methodologies to cover the fundamentals of creating a winning pitch. We think about the audience and their specific needs, define key messages, create a compelling storyline, design handsome visuals, work out the specifics of pitching virtually, and allow time for a question and answer session.\nAfter the semi-finals, the field is narrowed to seven teams. This is when we roll up our sleeves and work team by team with each of the finalist to level up their semifinal pitches and hone their delivery styles.\nThe challenge is always the same for everyone, how to present in just a few minutes a complicated project. One such example is that which was faced by team Switch-E, who eventually won the social impact prize. Their project takes on the climate change issue. They have developed an app that you can use to turn off unnecessary electrical appliances during the spike periods of demand when electricity is not only more expensive, but is often much dirtier because clean suppliers have to buy electricity from coal or other based plants at a premium. The challenge was how to tell the story of involving climate change, electricity markets, and consumer behavior. Our solution was to base it around the simple idea that everyone matters, and every action counts. We showed how a college student on a budget and worried about her future on the planet could make a big impact by using the app to turn off all but critical appliances during the peak. And not only that, she could entice her friends to do the same by a gamified community building feature of the app.\nWorking on all the pitches in this manned resulted in a final round where the judges were wowed by the improvements of the presentations from the state they were in during the semifinals.\nThis live competition is streamed internationally and is keenly watched by hundreds of potential angel investors, venture capital firms, and interested business leaders. Many unicorns have gotten their start from this competition and we are happy to play our part. We all are winners as these young entrepreneurs work a way to make the world a better place.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/12/23/2021-12-23-it-is-always-the-season-for-giving/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"It is always the Season for Giving"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Say what you like about Boris Johnson, his style connects with the mob. Our institutional leaders need to put aside their intellectual bias and start figuring out why it’s working.\nLast month in London, Boris Johnson gave a speech at the Confederation of British Industry in South Shields in the North of England. He stumbled, got lost in his notes, and started talking about Peppa Pig. You might start reading this and assume where it’s going. That a British prime minister talking about a children’s cartoon character, a Picasso-esque hairdryer shaped pig, in an address to senior business leaders, was an embarrassment and makes the UK look weak on the international business stage? Perhaps, but mock Boris Johnson at your peril.\nWhile we can debate the seriousness of the example and question its suitability for the audience, you have to admit that he knows how to make a headline and he knows how to keep us engaged. It was yet another stroke of headline-grabbing genius. Not often do we see someone who possesses such a unique talent for taking risk in public speaking and fearlessly breaking the rules of communication strategy. Despite many conversations I have with clients, friends, and family, who frown on Johnson’s style, he is a skilled public speaker. He’s original, has a commanding vocabulary yet knows how to keep it simple. He possesses a likability that keeps people voting for him, even when it goes against their own interests.\nIn my line of work, I am brought in to help people find this kind of creativity, to find analogies and anecdotes that resonate and help people extrapolate meaning from the numbers. If you follow the logic of Johnson’s Peppa Pig example, it checks out. He’s trying to say that this theme park, Peppa Pig World, which, according to Johnson in his speech, brings in 6 bn into the UK economy and was initially dismissed by the BBC as a bad idea, has proved to be another beacon of a deeply innovative UK creative business spirit against all odds. Many clients come to me with a need for ideas to communicate easily and effectively across their teams. Many leaders and companies would benefit from a more direct and imaginative style of communication, even if they think they don’t.\nI work with many types of business leaders and executives. One type of leader I have particularly had the privilege of working with over the years are our senior leaders in UN organizations. In my mind these are bastions of our collective civilized cooperation and should be cherished as such. Our institutions are the bedrock of our progress, comprising of societies’ finest minds, each of them having worked tirelessly to educate themselves and rise to the top of their classes. However, there is a pervasive culture of stiff and scripted communication around its senior leadership which struggles against the easy appeal of a populist leader. Already at least one half of any population around the world are tuned out of and aren’t interested in the press conferences given by the likes of the WHO or the ECB. Our institutions need to adapt their communication in 2021, make it more accessible, easier to follow (and yes, sometimes remove the ties around the necks of its speakers).\nNow I understand the argument that populist leaders should be ignored, that they are the problem in itself, but this is not true. A lot of people compare Johnson with Trump, which is fair; Trump has a similar instinctiveness for his crowd and they both like to make headlines. It just remains to be seen how Jonson will deal with the next transition, whether he’ll put country first or not. But breaking the rules and being creative does not always mean an autocrat in the making.\nTake what you secretly like from Johnson and leave the rest.\nTo finish this article, I too have opinions on Boris Johnson, but they have no place here. I will finish on one thought, though. When we work with business leaders, one of the core principles we use is to be disciplined. Know your audience and your key messages in advance, then work out how you will deliver them. So while Peppa Pig got us talking, digging a little deeper and using a little more graft might have yielded a better result. Boris Johnson’s comradery and risk-taking is what makes him appealing, but it is also his greatest weakness. He relies too much on his talents and luck, and no speaker should. History shows us that when that luck runs out, it usually gets pretty ugly. I hope for him when it’s inevitably time to move on he’ll accept that with good humor and foresight.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/12/07/2021-12-07-boris-johnson-s-peppa-pig-moment/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"Boris Johnson’s Peppa Pig Moment"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Why a 13-year-old speech given by a former US president holds a blueprint solution for our modern problem.\nIn 2008, during his campaigning, Barack Obama gave a rallying speech in Wisconsin on the power of words and resistance to hope. “Don’t tell me words don’t matter! I have a dream, just words?! All men are created equal, just words?!” It’s true that speeches don’t solve all problems, but what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again then it doesn’t matter how many policies and plans we have.\nIt was a rebuke on cynicism and inertia from elements within his own political establishment who saw Obama’s messaging as blind optimism. “Don’t tell me ideals and inspiration don’t matter. Don’t tell me hope doesn’t matter!” he goes on to say in reference to coming from a broken home and modest means “because it’s very unlikely that I’m standing on this stage here tonight.”\nWithout going through the whole speech, the main idea that Obama planted here is that hope can conquer adversity by inspiring courage in all of us to dare to face that adversity. He challenges this when he says “Kennedy didn’t look up at the moon and say ‘that’s too far. We can’t go.’ False hopes. Martin Luther King didn’t stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and say, ’go home everybody. The dream’s deferred. False hopes. You all need a reality check.”\nIn hindsight of Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure, he had an undeniable positive impact on the world. Stronger international relations and economies, a recovered domestic economy, better access to health care for all. There were also some domestic missteps such as the handling of the Flint water crisis and a seeming ineptitude with dealing with Republicans who always seemed to get the upper hand.\nSo why am I talking about this now? Because in that 2008 speech is the template of arguments for what needs now as we face the mother of all complex problems. Climate change.\nWhen he says that \u0026ldquo;nothing worthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere was willing to hope\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, nothing worthwhile has ever happened without someone willing to hope and taking the courage to act, then counters with “That’s how slaves and abolitionists resisted that wicked system. That’s how that greatest generation defeated Hitler and rose out of a Great Depression and That’s how women won the right to vote.” The list goes on…\nObama talks about hope in the face of adversity. In a nutshell, dealing with complex problems in a determined, cool, constructive manner by garnering support through inspiration, specifics and optimism. Because fear and greenwashing breed inertia. Life is awash with problems and gravity, puling us down. To quote another American, Sylvester Stallone, who recently said in a documentary that \u0026ldquo;we as people are all dealing with problems in life. Those who succeed the most in their lives are those dealing with their problems in the smartest way\u0026rdquo;.\nIn 2021, we have a huge complex challenge, which is climate change. It is perhaps our greatest problem ever. Listening to our leaders today at COP 26, a lot of it sounds like blind optimism. It’s no doubt that Greta Thunberg’s honesty is not only stark but at times disheartening. She’s angry and so should she be, her generation, my son’s generation, will have to deal with this nightmare if left unchecked.\nBut what’s the resistance to it all? Inertia? Pessimism? Denial? Most likely fear. The simple truth is we all owe banks money, we all need to eat today, so everybody keeps chipping away in the same direction, working hard, despite ourselves, because we all fear losing what we have. This is how difficult the problem is.\nThe story and the words that we need are templated right here in Barack Obama’s words. What’s needed are ideas and solutions but above all we need hope. Without it, we will never have the courage to take the leap of faith. Leaders hold the key, their words, their mindsets can cascade to get the bottom-up solution we need. The template is there, somebody else just needs to pick up the baton.\nArnold Schwarzenegger recently said in a BBC interview on climate change is that “citizens all over the world don’t just need metrics and tons, they need a story.” They need to understand that the problem is theirs, maybe not now, but it will be, and we all have to own a piece of it.\nObama was a great US President, an inspirer in chief and not without his flaws. But it’s not the messenger here that I’m talking about. It’s the message. We can all take that message and put it to good use today.\nWilling to hope on radical solutions is the only thing that can take us beyond climate change, and getting that message right, and delivered convincingly is what we are dedicated to and why we created our company. What can you do?\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/11/09/2021-11-09-word-matter/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Words Matter: words breed inspiration, inspiration breeds hope, hope breeds action."},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Business Presentation Revolution covers the five stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, giving you a simple, proven process to follow to prepare and deliver successful presentations every time.\nIn this extract from Business Presentation Revolution, author Phil Waknell outlines the fifth and final stage: Connection.\nHaving the fastest, best designed and most attractive car doesn’t guarantee you’ll win the race. The performance of the driver is just as important.\nLikewise, when presenting, a poor performance can make great material fall flat, but a strong presenter can make average material shine.\nIn the Connection stage, we prepare mentally and physically to ensure we are ready to make a personal connection with our audience, communicate with them, and transform them.\nNo business audience enjoys a monologue or a speaker who appears to be talking to themselves. Remember: it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. Since communication is more about what they receive than what you send, it’s vital to build a connection with them so they are part of your presentation and paying full attention.\nThis means you need to pay attention to your audience and how they are reacting to your messages – and adapt your presentation accordingly. Aim to interact with your audience as much as possible and to bring them into the presentation. The more you can connect on a personal, human level with your audience, the more likely they will be to overlook your imperfections and want you to succeed – and the more attentively they will listen.\nRemember your transformational objectives. What do you need your audience to do, feel and believe? Your objective is not to deliver your presentation exactly as planned: it is to transform your audience.\nHere is a brief summary of the key points of this all-important final stage:\n  Good speakers SCORE when speaking:\n Simple: use short sentences and plain language, with regular pauses Clear: make sure they can hear and understand every syllable Original: find your own style, accept it and hone it Related: create a connection through interaction, eye contact and gestures Enjoyable: prepare well so you appear comfortable, show your passion, and vary your tone and rhythm    As the big day approaches, focus on the 3 S’s:\n Serenity: rehearse your presentation several times, focusing especially on the introduction and conclusion, and prepare a cue-card Space: get to know the place or platform where you will be presenting Support: connect with the technical people and brief them, so they know what you need and can help you succeed.    On the big day, arrive early, try to greet some audience members before you begin, avoid coffee, prepare yourself physically, and manage your time well.\n  After the presentation, deliver your handouts, ask for feedback, and note what you could do differently next time.\n  Above all, treat every presentation you give as an opportunity to practice and improve. Nobody was born a great presenter. If you’re amazed at how professional the speakers appear at TED or WikiStage or some major online product launches, and feel you aren’t yet at the same level, just remember that those presenters had to work hard to become that good, and they usually have presentation specialists to help them.\nI have never yet met anyone who did not have the potential to become a strong speaker. With time, effort and perhaps some speaker coaching, you can become the kind of presenter people look forward to listening to.

So, if your slide features a lot of text and detail, it might make a useful reference document but a terrible visual aid. If you follow my advice and keep your slides simple, with only a few words, they’ll be good visual aids but worthless as handouts.\nMost people try to do something in the middle and end up with too little text for a useful reference document but too much for a visual aid – 50% slide, 50% document, 0% effective.\nIn the Illustration stage, you will first work out whether your audience will benefit from handouts, then determine whether some slides might help them during your presentation, and if so, prepare suitable visual aids that won’t stop them from listening.\nWhat you say is important, but the quality of your visual aids can have a huge positive or negative impact. Telling a great story with ugly slides is like giving somebody expensive jewelry in a supermarket plastic bag.\nI think of slides as “visual aids” for a presentation, and just that semantic change helps clients break out of the typical perception of a slide and focus on what kind of visuals will aid their audience’s understanding and recollection of their key messages.\nYour slides should SCORE:\n Simple: Each time you click, your audience should understand all the new content in under five seconds. If they take more than five seconds to “get it”, they will miss what you are saying. Clear: Everything is easy to read and understand on a smartphone screen, in terms of size and contrast. Original: Your slides look new and stand out compared to competitors’ and other speakers’ slides. Related: What you show is related to what you are saying at that time. Enjoyable: Your slides are well-designed and attractive, making your audience enjoy discovering each new slide.  You might also need to deliver some handouts. No matter how well your slides SCORE, the audience will soon forget what you say and what you show, so it may be wise to give them something to read before your presentation and to leave something behind – but not an ugly slideument that is neither a good slide nor a good document.\nHere is an overview of the pSCORE method for illustrating your storyline:\n Prepare any necessary handouts for your audience to read before, during or after your presentation. Split your storyline into paragraphs or points, and, for each part, work out whether your audience would benefit from a visual aid to help them understand and/or remember it. Where a visual aid might help, identify the most appropriate kind: a physical action, perhaps with an object; a video; a whiteboard or flipchart; or a slide. Sketch any slides you need on paper or sticky notes. Create a storyboard containing your sketches and clear instructions for your designer. Complete the pSCORE Slide Design Checklist* to ensure you are telling your designer everything they need to know. (If you are designing your own slides, this can still be helpful.) If the first version of your slides is perfect, great! If not, provide clear slide-by-slide instructions showing your designer what to change so the second version is exactly what you need. When you receive the second version, double-check that all transitions, animations and fonts look exactly as they should, and that you are comfortable delivering your presentation with these slides.  By the end of the Illustration stage, you should have your story and slides, perhaps with some useful handouts, and you can move on to the Connection stage, where you will prepare to deliver your presentation to your audience. Like the Foundation stage at the start of the process, the Connection stage is often neglected or rushed, yet it can make the difference between failure and success.\nTo learn more about this and the other stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, get your paperback copy of Business Presentation Revolution from Amazon or any good bookseller. Also available as an e-book from Amazon.\n* This checklist and many other downloadable supporting materials are available on a special web site: the link is in the book.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/07/22/2021-07-22-pscore_stage_4_illustration/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"pSCORE Stage 4: Illustration"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Business Presentation Revolution outlines the five stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, giving you a simple, proven process to follow to prepare and deliver successful presentations every time.\nIn this extract from Business Presentation Revolution, author Phil Waknell outlines the third stage: Creation.\nIn the first and second stages, you should already have studied your Audience, their Burning needs and the Context (ABC), set one or more objectives for transforming what your audience believes, feels and/or does, and found all the raw materials necessary to achieve those objectives. In the Creation phase, you mix all these ingredients together using the art of storytelling, ending up with a compelling storyline for your presentation.\nThe key revolution here is that you need to create your storyline before you start producing any slides. Too many presenters move straight ahead and open PowerPoint, producing many slides but without thinking about what they’re going to say. Slides exist to illustrate what you’re saying: you’re not there to comment on slides.\nInstead, we’ll apply the art of storytelling. Even if your sales targets have nothing to do with fantasy or your product’s advertised features aren’t just a fairy-tale, storytelling is the most effective way to get your message across to your audience.\nStorytelling in business goes way beyond telling stories.\nThe first responsibility of every presenter is to keep the audience awake and fully attentive. If they are attentive, they are influenceable; and if they are influenceable, they can be transformed. The opposite is also true.\nYou need to produce an original presentation every time, and that means using the power of story to grab their attention at the start, maintain it all the way through and wrap everything up properly at the end.\nThere are three main aspects of storytelling in business presentations:\n Structure: think of your presentation as one big story, structured using storytelling techniques. Anecdotes: inside that big story, include smaller stories, examples and anecdotes to make your key messages stick. ‘Chocolate chips’: while plain cookies can be good, it’s the chocolate chips that make them especially enjoyable and moreish. In your presentation, include analogies, surprises, actions and other storytelling techniques to reset your audience’s attention and make your presentation more enjoyable.  Here’s a summary of the steps to follow in the Creation phase, as explained in Business Presentation Revolution:\n Simple: After completing the Foundation and Ideation phases, create a seventy-word ‘elevator pitch’, answering the questions: “What? So what? What next?” This will help you identify your key messages and provides a good first draft of your conclusion.  - What? What are the key messages they should remember?\n- So what? Why are these messages important to them?\n- What next? Now they understand what you are saying and why it is important to them, what do you need from them?\nClear and Related: Choose a structure that suits your objectives and the ABC of your presentation. Take the content ideas from your Ideation brainstorm and plug them into the structure you chose. Discard what you don’t need and fill in any gaps. Original and Enjoyable: If you wish, build in a concept or theme that makes the presentation more memorable. Include some anecdotes or examples to make your key messages stick and keep your audience’s attention. Wake up your audience and turn over the hourglass of their attention with a MAGIQ Moment: something you say, show or do that Makes A Great Impression Quickly. Use your elevator pitch as the basis for a conclusion that reminds your audience of your key messages, explains why they are important and relevant to them, and tells them what you want them to remember, believe, feel and/or do afterwards: the “What?” the “So what?” and the “What next?” If you have a big enough audience, prepare a powerful last line and finish with a simple “Thank you” to make them want to clap and to give them their cue. Prepare an introduction that creates an emotional reaction in your audience and makes them feel like they want to listen. Then, and only then, consider adding an agenda. Finally, make sure your presentation is a personal talk from you to your audience. If someone else could deliver it, or if you could deliver it to another audience, it’s not personal enough.  Following these steps will put you way ahead of most presenters and ensure your storyline grabs their attention, and keeps it until the end, communicating your key messages memorably. This matters because attention leads to action, and only an attentive audience can help you achieve your transformational objectives.\nBy the end of the Creation phase, you should know what you’re going to say, and you should be confident it will allow you to achieve your transformational objectives. Then, and only then, you can start thinking about whether to illustrate your talk, and if so, what kind of visual aids might help your audience.\nTo learn more about this and the other stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, get your paperback copy of Business Presentation Revolution from Amazon or any good bookseller.

This means you need to find ideas, because ideas are the raw material of a successful presentation.\nAs we’ve already seen in previous chapters, your aim is not to inform but to transform your audience somehow: from prospects into customers, from skeptics into believers, from observers into actors, or perhaps from unhappy employees into happy, motivated contributors.\nImagine your audience on one side of a river, the ‘before’ side; your aim in your presentation or meeting is to take them to the other side, the ‘after’ side.\nYou are not going to just stand on the ‘after’ side and shout, “Hey, look at my great idea – come over here!” Unless your idea is truly fantastic, they’re not going to swim across to find you. It’s up to you to start from their side, provide the right stepping-stones to allow them to cross, and then guide them to your destination.\nToo many presenters fail to transform their audiences because they start from their own level of expertise and knowledge, and their wisdom goes over their audience’s heads. They are standing on their ‘after’ bank of the river, shouting into the mist about how wonderful it is, and have no idea where the audience is or whether they can hear or understand them. That’s no way to transform people.\nYou can’t take someone from point A to point B without starting from point A alongside them. And to do that, you need to know where point A is.\nFour steps to understanding\nThere are four simple yet powerful questions you can ask yourself to help you understand where your audience is before your presentation. In relation to your objectives, company, products, services, project, ideas, etc.:\n What do they know?  This relates to relevant facts that they know for certain before your presentation.\nFor example, they may know the sales figures this quarter are 30% down versus last year.\nWhat do they believe?  This includes things they think they know but which we cannot put in the ‘know’ section for one of the following reasons:\n They are wrong. They aren’t sure. They are speculating about what might happen. They are making a judgment.  For example, still using the example of a CEO of a 1000-person company:\n They believe you will take a bonus despite the poor results (wrong). They believe you’ve been looking for an excuse to reduce headcount (unsure). They believe you will announce job losses (speculation). They believe the company strategy is crazy (judgment).  What do they feel?  This is their emotional state as it relates to your presentation, before you begin.\nFor example, they may feel demotivated, afraid, angry, frustrated or pessimistic.\nWhat do they do?  This relates to actions they take.\nFor example, they may focus on selling big long-term contracts that don’t provide quick income, or they may accept long payment terms without negotiating, or they don’t collaborate effectively to boost sales.\nYou can answer these questions using the Audience Transformation Roadmap table, which you can draw on a board or flipchart. You can also fill it in on a computer or tablet (although remember that I recommend avoiding screens and computers while you’re trying to be creative).\nAfter you have worked out what they know, believe, feel and do before your presentation, you will answer the same questions for your audience after your presentation.\nNow that you have a clear ‘before’ and ‘after’ state for each of the four points in your roadmap and we know how we need to transform our customers, it’s time to plot how to make those changes.\nThis is where the middle column comes in: the Transformation Column. If you’ve drawn the Audience Transformation Roadmap on a flipchart or whiteboard, once you’ve filled in the “Before” and “After” columns, take some sticky notes and brainstorm ideas to fill in the Transformation Column.\nOnce you’ve filled your Transformation Column with sticky notes about how you can change what your audience knows, believes, feels and does, put these sticky notes in a logical order, like stepping-stones, and that will give you a first version of the structure of your presentation.\nThe Foundation and Ideation stages will set you up for success if you take the time to complete them; yet, most presenters don’t make the effort. If your objectives are worth taking time to present to your audience, they are also worth the preparation time. If you ace your preparation, you are likely to ace your presentation.\nYou can find more information about the Audience Transformation Roadmap here, as well as a downloadable template. You can also learn more about it in the TEDx talk below.\n  ","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/06/18/2021-06-18-pscore_stage_2_ideation/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"pSCORE Stage 2: Ideation"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Business Presentation Revolution outlines the five stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, giving you a simple, proven process to follow to prepare and deliver successful presentations every time.\nIn this extract from Business Presentation Revolution, author Phil Waknell outlines the vital first stage: Foundation.\nIf you build a house on sand, it will not be stable; likewise, if you start to prepare a presentation without understanding its context or its audience, you will be setting yourself up for failure. Even if you only spend a few minutes on your foundation, those will be the most important minutes you spend on your presentation.\nBy the end of the Foundation stage, you’ll have a clear transformational objective for your presentation and a good understanding of your audience, and you’ll be ready to begin thinking about what to say.\nStart With ABC The first step to reaching that point, though, is to forget about what you want to say. Put that to one side for now and focus on your audience, their burning needs and the context in which your presentation will happen – the ABC of presentation preparation:\n Audience: a clear and detailed understanding of the people who will watch and listen to your presentation. Burning needs: knowing what keeps these people awake at night, their problems and their objectives. Context: your context, the audience’s context and the context of the presentation itself.  By focusing on your audience right from the start, instead of on yourself, you are laying the foundation for a successful presentation. As much as possible, try not to think of your audience’s needs through the prism of your own situation. You’ll have plenty of time to think about your own objectives and messages later in the process.\nTransformational Objectives Fixing the presentation problem and joining the Business Presentation Revolution does not only mean creating and delivering better presentations. It also means knowing when to present – and when not to.\nMost presentations fail because they try to transmit information, which is more effectively achieved with a written document. We forget most of what we hear very quickly. Oral presentations (with or without slides) are fantastic for inspiring, motivating and transforming audiences, but using an oral presentation to share information is like using a colander to carry water. While it is good for some things, this is not one of them. However, a presentation is an excellent way to change what people believe, feel and do. If you don’t change your audience in any way, then you’ve wasted your time – and, worse still, you’ve wasted theirs. To set your transformational objectives, simply complete this sentence:\n “After this presentation, the audience will…”  Make sure the verb in the last part of the sentence is a ‘feeling’ or ‘doing’ verb. If you find yourself with the verb “know” (or something similar), ask yourself why they need to know this – and then complete the sentence again with the real objective.\nSummary The Foundation stage may not take long, but it is time too few presenters choose to spend. If you understand your audience, their burning needs and the context, and choose a few transformational objectives, then you are ready to start preparing your presentation. If not, you are shooting at an invisible target with both hands tied behind your back. Business productivity requires efficiency, but the Foundation stage is not a corner you can cut: it is the fastest path to success.\nFind out more about the Foundation stage, and the four other stages of the pSCORE Method, in the book Business Presentation Revolution, published in July 2021.

Audiences don’t appreciate speakers who haven’t prepared properly, don’t know their presentation well enough, and are visibly worrying about what to say next.\nThere are several simple actions you can take before your presentation to maximize your own comfort and help you to deliver a better talk. I call them the 3 S’s: serenity, space and support.\n Serenity  Whether you prefer to improvise or learn your speech, you should rehearse it aloud several times, filming yourself if you can, and making sure you take no more than 90% of the time allocated for your presentation (not including any time for questions and answers). The fifth run-through will be much better than the first, and you will be more comfortable with the flow of your presentation and better equipped to react, adapt and improvise if needed.\nIf preparing your presentation is like mixing the ingredients for a cake, then rehearsing is like baking it. Most cakes are not edible raw, but you should not burn them either. Rehearse enough, but closer to five times than fifty. You’re aiming for a personal connection, not a perfect delivery.\nIn particular, rehearse your introduction and conclusion, even if you aim to improvise much of your presentation. The beginning is where you will feel the most stress, and where the audience will form an initial impression of you, so knowing how you will begin your presentation will give you the best chance of a strong first impression. Equally, knowing your conclusion well should make their final impression just as positive.\nYou should also prepare a cue-card: write a few words to remind you of the flow of your presentation on a small piece of paper to keep in your pocket. This way, you won’t worry about forgetting what to say – and because you will feel more comfortable, you’ll remember your flow more easily.\n Space  Familiarizing yourself with the place or online platform in which you will be presenting will help you feel more relaxed. Try to get access to the room, stage or application in advance so you are not discovering it at the start of your presentation.\n Support  The people handling the technology are your friends, as long as you seek them out in advance, ask them about any limitations and make sure they know what you need from them. For a presentation with a live audience, this means the microphones, lighting, sound and screen. For an online presentation, it means the people who will be responsible for the online platform, screen sharing, spotlighting your video and making sure only the right microphones are live.\nOnce these important people are properly briefed and on your side, you will feel ready and calm. Knowing that they have tested your slides in real conditions will give you one less thing to worry about.\nFind out more in this short video featuring our Chief Coaching Officer, Michael Rickwood, with host Rose Bloomfield.\n  ","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/06/02/2021-06-02-how_do_you_prepare_yourself_before_a_big_presentation/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"How do you prepare yourself before a big presentation?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"I’m not a motor mechanic. I don’t play with my car’s engine, hoping to make it run better, because I don’t understand how it works in detail. I leave that to experts who are professionally trained and experienced.\nThe human brain is far more complex than an engine, and we know far less about how it works. Trying to present without learning a little about how the brain works is like throwing a spanner into a car and hoping it will fix the brakes.\nDon’t worry, I’m not going to get all neurological here. I’m just going to give you a few highlights about what presenters need to know. I believe this is required knowledge for giving presentations because when you present, you’re trying to change what’s in your audience’s brains in some way. The following points are my own conclusions based on reading many books and papers, as well as my own experience. If you need to see the science behind these simple statements, I recommend the excellent Brain Rules by Dr. John Medina and anything by Richard Wiseman or Richard Mayer.\n There is no such thing as ‘divided attention’: there is ‘undivided attention’, or distraction. If you don’t have your audience’s undivided attention, they won’t properly understand or remember what you’re saying. Attention spans are short, even for interesting material, and almost zero for anything boring. When it comes to presentations, two synonyms for ‘boring’ are ‘typical’ and ‘predictable’. Human beings cannot simultaneously listen to one thing and read another. We forget most of what we hear, very quickly. The more we say, the less people remember.  Business presenters need to know what science already knows about how their audiences pay attention and how they learn. Most presenters don’t work hard enough to gain or retain attention; they expect people to read and listen simultaneously, they don’t use memorable images, their presentations are too long and they usually say too much for fear of leaving something out.\nAll of this can be doubly relevant for online presentations. Where a live audience might be able to pay attention to their boss for twenty minutes, that attention span may only be ten minutes in an online meeting, where the speaker doesn’t know whether the participants are paying attention – and where the participants know that the speaker doesn’t know.\nA presentation is hard work. If the presenter doesn’t put in the hard work, it will be hard work for the audience.\nThis is an extract from Business Presentation Revolution, the new book by Phil Waknell, published 7/14/21.

Shorter, more personal, more visual and more memorable, we now have thousands of talks to choose from providing us with a learning platform as awesome as Wikipedia. Business has benefited from it in miraculous ways. Garr Reynolds, author of Presentation Zen, once coined a great phrase: the ‘Ted-ification of business presentations’. Thanks in part to TED, but also to a certain extent to the original presentations of Steve Jobs, we all benefit from simpler, clearer, more original, more relevant and dare I say it more entertaining business presentations. However, with familiarity comes contempt and the new normal brings challenges. There are two key points we need to remember when presenting in business: boundaries and context. There are thousands of dud TED Talks out there but even great ones have elements that can’t be replicated in a business setting. When I first started working in business 15 years ago here in Paris, most people practiced the approach of keeping their private life and their working life separate, sometimes so much so that most people took little interest in their day-to-day slog and reserved their passions for the evenings and weekends. Today the landscape is changing and I believe for the better as people bring their creativity into their white-collar work. But a delicate balance needs to be struck. What TED has encouraged is connection between speaker and audience, and this connection requires vulnerability, something that is celebrated at TED events. However, when presenting in business contexts, while encouraging transparency, inspiration, humour and warmth, you should avoid crossing the boundary into your personal affairs. I remember running a workshop at a major pharma company 6 years ago. I invited the participants to share some of their personal stories in the workshop as a speaking exercise. While some stayed within appropriate personal limits, others did not, and it slowly transformed into an exercise which was not appropriate for the context. After realizing the error I wound the session down gently. It’s true in TED that people share deeply personal things; in business however we need to be very selective. I notice this happening also on Clubhouse. This is often a place where business professionals congregate to exchange ideas, network and/or sell their consulting or coaching services in rooms devoted to business topics. But all too often the participants get too personal within those rooms, sometimes selling their skills or expertise on the back of deep traumatic pain, wearing it like a medal. Business presentations need to be effective, clear and have emotional appeal but business presentations and sales pitches really need boundaries. Another issue is not observing formality, particularly with language: the use of slang, profanity and over-familiar terms for example. You should also avoid content which isn’t appropriate for the context. Many different cultures and organizations will frown upon this. Telling a joke that doesn’t fit for a cheap laugh, or talking about your hangover, is not professional. What examples and analogies are you using? Are they appropriate? The context should also guide your slide design choices. If you are selling your services to Chanel or L’Oréal, I wouldn’t put cartoon characters on your slides. If you are presenting at the World Bank on the topic of developing wind farms in the Seychelles, should you be showing an image from Love Island to frame the context? I think a lot of what I write here is common sense, practiced by many business professionals, but post-TED does present new challenges for business. By all means use TED for inspiration and to see examples of powerful presentations, but when applying that to your business presentations, remember your boundaries, and take care to adapt to the context.\nWhen there is so much noise in our content-rich world, it’s all the more important to strike the right tone.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/05/25/2021-05-25-what_s_the_right_tone_for_business_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What’s the right tone for Business Presentations?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"There is no such thing as a perfect presentation. You should of course prepare and rehearse it enough so you know it well, and so your messages come from the heart, not the head. If you can focus on delivering not just the syllables of your words, but the meaning behind them, then you are ready to present. Do not overdo the rehearsals, though. Your audience does not expect absolute perfection, and if you can create a strong connection with them, they will accept your imperfections, and see you as more human. Focus not on trying to speak perfectly, but on making a personal connection with your audience, one member at a time.\nRemember: it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. Since communication is more about what they receive than what you send, it’s vital to build a connection with them, so they are part of your presentation, paying full attention, and truly listening.\nThis means you need to pay attention to them, and how they are reacting to your messages – and adapt your presentation accordingly. Aim to interact with your audience as much as possible, and to bring them into the communication.\nThe more you can make a personal, human connection with your audience, the more likely they will be to overlook your imperfections, and to want you to succeed – and the more attentively they will listen.

If your boss asks you: “Have you prepared your presentation?” what she really means is: “Have you prepared your PowerPoint® slides?”\nThis means that presenters automatically assume that they will use PowerPoint® slides, and do not even consider that there may be other possibilities.\nAsk yourself, for each point in your presentation: does my audience really need any visual aids? Don’t assume they do. I’ve worked on TEDx talks where a speaker has produced some very good slides, but when I’ve ended up convincing him that his audience doesn’t need them, and would do better without them. In my own TEDx talk, there are parts where I now think I’d have done better not to have slides on the screen. In most sales presentations, slides are just a barrier: it’s better to have a conversation.\nIf you decide that your audience will benefit from some kind of visual aids, you should then ask yourself whether you can use a physical action to illustrate what you are saying. This could mean doing something with your hands, or an object, like Steve Jobs pulling an iPod Nano from the smallest pocket of his jeans.\nPeople remember what you do far better than what you project, even if your slides are great.\nIf there’s no suitable object or action for this point, the next question should be: would a flip-chart or whiteboard (or similar modern media like smartboards or a Zoom whiteboard) be a good way to illustrate what I am saying?\nIf the answer is no, then and only then should you consider using slides. Since you are giving suitable handouts anyway (right?), you do not need to produce slides for your audience to take away. You only need them if they help to make what you are saying easier or quicker to understand, and/or more memorable.\nThe key with any tool is knowing when not to use it. If you only have a hammer, you’ll treat everything like a nail; if you assume you are going to use PowerPoint, then you restrict yourself to one illustration method when other choices may be better, and the right choice may be no visual aids at all.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published July 2021.

Whether it’s a psychological drama like American Beauty, a sci-fi movie like Star Wars or an action movie like Mission: Impossible, the same structure, plot points and character development techniques are used. I’ll just take one as an example: the hero, the main protagonist, is always an orphan, literally or figuratively, or experienced a personal drama; it is supposed to give the character more likeness. Luke Skywalker is an orphan. Jack Dawson, the hero from Titanic, leaves everything behind as a third-class passenger. Fin, the hero from Sharknado, is divorced.\nIf I mention the Hollywood formula for movies, it’s because people often ask me if there is a foolproof formula for a great talk. Well, just like for movies, there are elements which are in every great talk such as establishing a connection with the audience and bringing an original, thought-provoking point of view, and I will concede that sharks flying in a tornado! is more original than boat meets iceberg. But with the same formula, you may end up with one of most viewed talk of all time, or you may end up with a series Z talk. Why? Because things that are harder to qualify, such as experience, tone, style and taste make a world of difference to the end result. Lack of experience can lead to basic mistakes, bad taste can turn off your audience, tone-deaf words can hurt your credibility. So yes, there is much more to a great talk than a formula, which is why benefiting from the experience of seasoned coaches can make a huge difference.\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter if you end up with a Titanic or a Sharknado type of presentation, as long as it fits your goal and audience. Because, ultimately, your talk is for them, not for you.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021-05-18/sharknado-is-the-same-movie-as-titanic-only-with-more-sharks/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Sharknado is the same movie as Titanic, only with more sharks"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Slides can be an extremely powerful way of making your messages clearer and more memorable – yet all too often they are an obstacle to communication.\nHumans can’t listen and read different things simultaneously: we can only process one linguistic input at a time. So if a slide features a lot of text and detail, it might make a useful reference document, but a terrible visual aid. On the other hand, if you keep your slides simple, with only a few words, they’ll be good visual aids but worthless as handouts.\nSo most people try to do something in the middle, and end up with not enough text to make for a useful reference document, but too much for a visual aid. 50% slide, 50% document, 0% effective. This is often known as a “slideument” – and it’s as horrible as it sounds.\nWhen it comes to a presentation, it’s important to underline just how different slides and handouts need to be.\n1. Slides are for projecting; handouts are for printing\nFor the audience, slides exist only as light projected on a screen for a short period of time, and they should be designed to work well on a projector screen, a flat screen monitor and/or an online meeting platform. Handouts, on the other hand, need to be designed so they can be printed if necessary.\n2. Slides support an oral speech; handouts replace it\nGood slides don’t stop the audience from listening; great slides help the audience to listen even more. Handouts, on the other hand, need to be standalone, i.e. clear and easy to understand for someone who missed the live presentation, or who is referring back to the content long after they forgot what the presenter said.\n3. Slides are for looking at; handouts are for reading\nSlides should be visual, allowing the brain’s linguistic processing to focus almost entirely on what the speaker is saying. Handouts, however, are intended for quiet reading: as there is no speaker to listen to, the brain can focus its linguistic processing on the document.\n4. Slides feature only key words; handouts have complete sentences and even paragraphs\nVisual slides will only have a few big words that we can understand quickly, so the audience can keep listening to the speaker. Handouts may feature full paragraphs so the reader can understand properly without ambiguity.\n5. Slides often have dark backgrounds; handouts usually have white backgrounds\nGood slides will often have dark backgrounds to avoid tiring the audience’s eyes. Most handouts, however, will have white backgrounds to make them easy to print without spending a fortune on toner or ink.\n6. Slides should avoid ‘visual pollution’; handouts should feature meta-data\nItems like the page number, the date or the author’s name are ‘visual pollution’ when projected on a screen, distracting the audience from what they should be looking at; yet in a handout, they are positive and helpful.\nThe obvious conclusion is that slides and handouts are so diametrically opposed in their objectives and characteristics that you couldn’t imagine trying to do both with one file. Or could you? Take a look at some of your recent slides and ask yourself whether you fell into the slideument trap.\nI am often asked whether it’s acceptable to produce documents in PowerPoint. My answer: yes, as long as you don’t try to use them as slides, and as long as you share them as a PDF file. PowerPoint can be an excellent tool to produce visually attractive documents, such as proposals. At Ideas on Stage, we often produce document templates in PowerPoint for our clients. You just need to resist the temptation to project those documents: they are not visual aids.\nIf you are going to treat PowerPoint as a kind of Swiss Army knife, remember only to use one tool at a time. Trying to prepare a slide and a handout in one go will be as unsuccessful as trying to use the corkscrew and blade at the same time, except that the pain will be for your audience.\nThis is an extract from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published on July 14th 2021.

We see examples of it in TED, top company Keynotes and our favorite lecturers and leaders. Yet still there are things that need to be changed. I have tried to collect them into what I call the 5 negatives followed by our very own revolution solutions!\nNo foundations, people are still too last minute, whether its completing that 20,000-word dissertation at university written the night before or the finance report mixed together from excels and spreadsheets in the metro the same morning. I have seen plenty of TED talks where the speakers arrive to the event with an overlong and convoluted talk. Lack of decent planning leads to difficult situations and loss of credibility. It can also heighten anxiety. Not entirely surewhat this is all about? Neither will your audience be. Not putting them first will not yield the results you want, and if the objective isn’t clear in the first place then it’ll be doubly hard. Always take the time to know your audience needs and context. The solution is Revolution 1 – It’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. A to A. A to A means instead of taking your audience from A to B or A to C they don’t actually go anywhere. No one wants to sit in a car going nowhere. Telling your life story without actually giving us a reason why it’s meaningful to the audience will not impress anyone. Asking your audience to sit and listen to you without actually achieving anything or giving instructions will not either. Every minute needs to be meaningful. Align your objectives to their needs. The solution is Revolution 2 – Aim not inform but to Transform.\nAudience Glazed Eyes. We’ve all been there. Sitting through that dull plodding presentation with no interaction, nor variation or clear transitions. Rambling introductions that start and stop like an outboard motor and conclusions that fall off a cliff of silence. Storytelling is not just something we just say to children every evening, now we all need it. The solution is Revolution 3 – Create your story before your slides.\nDeath by persistently dense slides. We’ve all heard the old wives’ tales**.** No more than 5 slides per presentation, 7 bullets per slide, PowerPoint should be banned outright. In 2021 everybody still has an opinion. Communication has different mediums and visual slides and the written documents are *2 separate* ones that each require different contexts. You can’t kill 2 birds with one stone trying to take a shortcut and ask the audience to read and listen at the same time, that will just kill your audience.\nThe solution is Revolution 4 – Don’t confuse slides with documents.\nPressure to be perfect. What’s theone thing behind most modern presenters anxiety? The raising of the bar of presentations from both the professional and the entertainment world. This has created a lot of pressure for the modern presenter, especially now much is being filmed and distributed online. Whether you are an executive, a start-up or an academic, being able to stand up and speak is an important career skill. But rest assured, no one can be better at you than you. So don’t compare yourself to others.\nThe solution is Revolution 5 – Aim not for perfect but personal.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/05/11/2021-05-11-what_are_the_few_big_things_we_need_to_change_to_fix_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What are the few big things we need to change to fix presentations?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"As our recent LinkedIn poll showed clearly, the number one thing people hate about presentations is when the speaker reads slides to the audience.\nWhy does anyone still do this? If you show them all the text, they can read it far more quickly than you can say it, and they will wonder why you didn’t just give them a document to read instead.\nIf you are going to read your bullet-points, and then comment on them, be aware that while you are talking about point 1, they have finished reading all 6 points on your slide, and are switching off until you catch up with them.\nSo let’s make three things very clear.\n Your slides are not your cue-card, existing only to help you to remember what to say because you didn’t prepare properly. They are visual aids for your audience. Your slides are not a document, to be shared offline as well as shown during your presentation. If you need to share something before or afterwards, send a proper standalone document, not a set of incomplete bullet-points that could be (mis)understood in many ways. You’re not there to comment on your slides. Your slides exist to illustrate and reinforce what you say, so your audience can understand it more clearly, and remember it for longer.  So we need to stop putting the cart before the horse. When we prepare a presentation, we first prepare the storyline so we know what we are going to say to the audience, and then we can ask ourselves whether, at some points, the audience will benefit from some visual aids. I invite you to throw away the idea that you need slides. By default, assume that your talk does not need slides, unless proven otherwise. Sir Ken Robinson’s famous TED talk, Do Schools Kill Creativity? uses no visual aids other than the images his stories create in our minds, and at the time of writing that is the most-viewed TED talk of all time.\nBut if slides are optional, a strong storyline is necessary. Prepare your story first, and then, if it will help your audience, by all means prepare some visual aids. You’ll be amazed how big a difference this simple process change can make. Often the smallest revolutions are the most important.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published in July 2021.

Many presenters treat their talk as if it were a dental appointment: their sole aim is to get through it as quickly and painlessly as possible, escape mostly unharmed, then drink something cool or strong, or perhaps both.\nOther presenters might say their aim is to share information: for example, to explain sales targets, or business results.\nIt’s important to dig a little deeper, and when it comes to objectives, the most useful word is ‘why’. Why are you explaining your sales targets? Is there perhaps something you want your audience to do differently? Perhaps just by knowing the targets they will behave differently, or feel more motivated to achieve them. In which case, you’ve changed them – and maybe that change was your real objective.\nMost presentations fail because they simply try to transfer information, which is far more effectively done via a written document. Experiments have demonstrated that people remember more of the information they read than the information they hear, as long as they have quiet time to read. So should you be presenting at all? If your sole aim is to move information between brains, then forget about an oral presentation: give them a written document and time to read it (and ideally a coffee too), and you’ll find that far more effective for everyone.\nHowever, a presentation is an excellent way to change what people believe, feel and do. If you don’t change your audience in any way, then you’ve wasted your time, and worse still, you’ve wasted theirs.\nYour objective is not to inform your audience, but to transform them.\nFor example, when Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, his presentation’s aim was not to share information – number of pixels, processor speed, etc. – but on one hand to create desire, and on the other hand to make people buy an iPhone, and write articles to recommend it. He wanted to generate feelings and actions. Of course his presentation included information, but only the information he required to achieve those transformational objectives.\nTo look at his objectives simply, if his audience had remembered all the iPhone’s specifications but did not want to buy it, would that have been a successful presentation? No. But if they forgot all the details yet still felt a strong desire to buy it, would that have been a success? Yes. So it’s clear that the objective is not transmitting information but generating transformation.\nYet far too many businesspeople still approach a presentation with the sole aim of sharing information. If you find yourself in that situation, ask yourself why they need this information and what transformation you aim to achieve. If there is no transformation required but you still need to share information, give them a proper document to read because that’s so much more effective than an oral presentation, and takes less of their time.\nThe world will be a better place when every presentation has transformational objectives, and when people share information in standalone documents instead of quickly-forgotten oral presentations.

Coach is one of my titles along with consultant, director, trainer and whatever else describes what I do, which is help people in all sectors and walks of life to give fantastic presentations in high stakes scenarios, or train them to be simpler, more natural, better prepared and highly impactful, whether on stage or on a digital platform.\nArtificial intelligence is all the rage these days, and last year Microsoft announced a new function in PowerPoint: The Presentation Coach. It’s an AI powered tool that helps you to rehearse and monitor your tone, keeps a word count tally per minute and will tell you off if you use too many filler words and profanity. After you’re finished it presents you with a dashboard telling you how you did, whether you need to improve or if everything was ok. After using it, I got a good score, but apparently I used too many fillers. The problem is: how do I tell a machine I’ve got an old motor tic problem?\nAdmittedly, like many people in many sectors, my first reaction to the idea of an AI doing the same job as me was dread. Is this the beginning of the end I said to myself? Already PowerPoint is proposing slide design ideas, now it can coach, what’s next? Is it going to deliver the presentation for you?\nIt’s true that if we take a wide angle lens view, the data doesn’t look good. According to McKinsey, 50% of all jobs could be automated by 2030, or at least 50% of the tasks that we currently perform. No industry will be spared, whether its industrial farming or yoga teaching. I don’t deny it, it remains a scary prospect for us all.\nBut what is clear to me, like in all sectors, is that we actually have a choice. Ignore it at your peril or embrace it and start using it to improve your offering.\nThink about life before predictive text? Or smart cameras on iPhones, or calendar apps? Hell, even dishwashers are smart nowadays. Augmented life is good.\nMy job is to listen to client presentations, brainstorm with them, look for contextual meaning in their messaging, find a visual story in my mind’s eye in order to help them produce slides, rehearse look for signs of poor concentration, anxiety and poor clarity. It’s true having a word count and feedback on whether they said the word ‘um’ 17 times is useful but frankly I’m ready to delegate this activity to a bot, hands down.\nJobs are evolving beyond our control and the boring stuff, the dangerous stuff and yes, all the stuff that a machine can do better and cheaper will slowly be removed from our job descriptions over time. So fight it, or work with it. We all have a choice. If I integrate this in to my rehearsals it will make for a better offering for my clients and provide me with an assistant that frankly doesn’t fulfill a job description for a real person. It also allows me to concentrate on stuff I’m better at.\nThere is one drawback, using this by itself might slow you down but it is not going to make you a better presenter. There is a risk that AI standardisation will alienate beautifully imperfect speakers. As with any AI, the tool can’t set the new standard and take away the humanity. And ultimately, it cannot give meaning and purpose to our words.\nSo, PPT Presenter Coach is here to stay. Using it will be useful, especially for me. I might have to toggle that anti-profanity option though, as swearing is apparently a sign of intelligence.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/04/27/2021-04-27-is-microsoft-s-powerpoint-presenter-coach-taking-my-job/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Is Microsoft’s PowerPoint Presenter Coach taking my job?

Everything was perfect: the products, the speakers, the locations, the scenography, the production. How proud Apple employees must feel today after such a great event. I have identified seven elements that set Apple apart from its competitors.\n Coaching. Get public speaking coaching. If you look at the video, the delivery of each speaker is impeccable: their diction, their voice, their posture, their body language. It always amazes me when I go, for example, to some top consulting firm only to be told, “Partners don’t need to be coached.” Here is the truth: most of your partners desperately need to be coached. Leadership. It is obvious, from the way the event is made, that Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple and main protagonist of the event, was heavily involved in its preparation. I will go further: the new format for the event was only possible because of Tim Cook’s leadership, sponsorship and direct involvement. While the event company behind it did most of the heavy lifting, ultimately Tim Cook took ownership of the result. Preparation. Something that most people will overlook is the insane amount of preparation required to reach such a level of perfection. If you decide to dedicate just one hour to the preparation of the event because you’re too busy, or worse, if you decide to just wing it, you will never make the cut for Apple’s event. Script. There was not a single boring moment in Apple’s event. Everything was well paced and fell into place naturally. Why? Because they took the time to build a detailed script in advance rather than throw stuff at the audience and see what sticks. Product. Each product is the best in its field, period. I know I am an Apple fanboy, but in the past I criticized the products that I found underwhelming (for example I still think the Mac Pro is an over-engineered and ugly mess, and let’s not talk about those $700 wheels). The event in itself is sleek, but what truly matters, the products, are insanely great. Quality. When we prepare an event, we often receive poorly filmed footage, shot in an untidy room, grainy and with terrible audio (background noise, low volume). While recent advances in image and audio treatment allow us to slightly improve the original material, there is no miracle: if you want your event look like a million dollars, it has to be filmed and recorded by professionals. There is no shortcut, but there is a final cut. Values. Say what you want about Apple, they put their money where their mouth is. The video included an excellent mix of people of different gender and ethnicity. I understand that the mix does not accurately represent Apple’s actual workforce and that some may find it unfair. It’s a question of choice and I think Apple does it right: you have to be the change you want to see in the world, or it will never happen. Speaking of values, it is good to see a high-tech company try to address the environmental issues it causes. However, Apple is far from perfect on that front, so I give them a C+ for effort.  There is one thing that was missing from the event: naturalness. It was so perfect that you lose a bit of human connection. But I think that Apple’s objective has been attained: they have set an incredibly high bar for their competitors. In the late nineties, when Steve Jobs came back at the helm of the company, he imprinted his trademark keynote style on product launches. It literally took years for other companies to catch up (and copy Apple’s keynote style). This time, I’m curious to see how long it will take for companies like Microsoft, Google, Intel or Nvidia to adapt.\nI will end this piece with one thought-provoking question: how long will it take for your company to adapt?\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021-04-21/seven-lessons-from-apple-spring-loaded-event/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Seven Lessons From Apple's Spring-Loaded Event"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"When I visit companies to speak about presenting, I don’t give the same talk to every company. I don’t even give the same talk to every function in a company. They are all different, and while a standard talk would meet their needs, you should be more ambitious than just meeting their needs. You should aim to delight them.\nA presentation is a gift. You could just give everyone a pair of socks for their birthday. Would that make them happy? Unlikely. Likewise, personalize your presentation for your specific audience and they will be delighted.\nDoes it take more time to personalize your presentations to your audience? Yes. But it’s worth it. A standard presentation is equally irrelevant to every audience. If you don’t care enough about them to personalize your talk, why should they care about you and what you are saying?\nA personalized presentation will make a much better connection, and therefore has a much better chance of achieving your objectives. If you’re going to take your own time, and an audience’s time, you should at least invest that time well and give yourself a chance of success.\nThe audience is the first magic ingredient of every presentation. It should be prepared for them, address them specifically – and the part about you is only to show how you can resolve their problems, needs or desires.\nAfter all, it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published in July 2021.

It brought the presentation revolution to a wider audience of enthusiasts. We propose to revisit five essential principles from the book that have stood the test of time and can still be considered as best presentation practices today.\n Plan analog. There are many theories that try to explain how creativity works, but one thing is sure. None of them advise you to get in front of your computer, launch PowerPoint and start hammering at your keyboard to add bullet points after bullet points. If anything, PowerPoint is going to kill your creativity and focus by distracting you from the essential. This is why Garr Reynolds and most creatives start their process with a pen and paper. iPad Pro with Apple pencil? Why not, but only if you are comfortable enough to use it effortlessly. Having to constantly break your flow to work out \u0026ldquo;how the hell do I do that?\u0026rdquo; is a sure creativity killer. Start with the end in mind. This simply means that before you start preparing, you should know exactly what result you expect from your presentation. This will help you sort out the content that must be included in your presentation from the content that can be left out. Remember that your goal should not be just to inform or entertain: ask yourself what is the change that you would like to see in your audience. Eat until 80% full. Many presenters tend to put too much stuff in their presentation. Why? Because this is what they learned in school: to give the most complete answers possible. And because they fear that otherwise their presentation will seem too simple or incomplete. But in presentations, complexity and data overload are your worst enemies. So, just as a good meal doesn\u0026rsquo;t overstuff you, resist the temptation to add those two extra slides that are nice to have but not indispensable. Use full bleed pictures to maximize their visual impact. The use of beautiful pictures that cover the whole slide is is something that has become a trademark of Garr\u0026rsquo;s presentations, and you should not hesitate to steal it! No other picture layout has the same impact, beauty and simplicity. Connect with the audience. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to sound \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; or like the teacher you had at school: it will only make you seem aloof and condescending, cutting the invisible but vital link with your audience. Instead, deliver your presentation as if you were having a conversation with a large group of friends. You will sound much more natural, authentic, and you will make people want to listen to you!

The task of gaining confidence while battling nerves and getting out in one piece is exhausting. Coaching, meditation, rehearsal, visualisation and psychotherapy are all strategies that professionals have turned to over the years to conquer the fear.\nHere at Ideas on Stage, we recognise the modern executive has no time and doesn’t wish to commit to self-help strategies. We also see many leaders who wish somebody else could deliver their presentations for them, but who know they have to be seen to be delivering the messages themselves.\nThis is why Ideas on Stage is proud and excited to launch a revolutionary solution: The Performance Buddy.\nThe Performance Buddy is a neural-engineered, brain-connected WIFI device which will allow the coach to take control of your body and voice, and present for you. Think of it like the film Avatar where the human controls the Naavi’s blue body from a distance. In this case, you are the blue body, controlled by one of our specialist presentation coaches.\nIt couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is to attach our amazing Performance Buddy to the back of your head and a relay emitter to your shirt lapel. Then one of our professional presenters, standing out of sight of the audience, will take over, walk your body on stage, and lend their expertise to articulate, gesticulate and speak convincingly with your hands, body and voice.\nIn short, one of our coaches will do the presentation for you while you observe from deep inside your subconscious: a calm, comfortable mind chamber we call The Buddy Zone.\nThis ground-breaking technology uses our patent-pending communication system: the Avatar Protocol for Remote Interactivity \u0026amp; Language.\nWe tested the Performance Buddy with several business leaders and one very well-known political leader, and while audiences noticed that they were more persuasive and less boring than usual, they never suspected that our Performance Buddy was behind their success.\nIn fact, the leaders enjoyed the experience so much, and gained so much time by not having to prepare their presentations, that they now use it all the time. Try it for yourself, and you’ll never think twice about handing the controls to one of our ace presenters who will drive you like a high-performance rally car.\nPlease note: all customers will need a full psychological evaluation beforehand and will need to sign a 65-page responsibility waiver in the event of a brain meltdown.\nYou’re probably wondering how much this amazing, revolutionary solution costs. The list price is $4,012,021, and this comes with unlimited presentations and technical support for a whole year.\nIf this is beyond your budget, but you want to learn more about effective presenting, our co-founder Phil Waknell is publishing a book this year: Business Presentation Revolution.

The numbers continue to rise, vaccines are rolling out slowly (here in Europe anyway) and governments and communities remain at loggerheads about what to do going forward. There is a general expectation that this status quo will continue to the end of the year and businesses are continuing to either postpone large in-person gatherings or are adopting alternative ones using the tools we have at our disposal.\nThe basic human need to get out there, see the world and meet each other has been put on ice. We still can’t even go and see a movie or dance around a handbag in a dark and noisy place.\nI sit here about to give my 30th webinar since the pandemic broke loose looking at a flat screen, remembering to look into the camera and keep my gestures visible, while seated or standing (which is better), wondering and hoping 2019 will come back. But the truth is, we know we can’t turn the clock back, and those who understand this are already making their way forward. The truth is, even once the virus has been beaten back we will still have THE underlying issue which is climate change. Governments all over the world are signing agreements to reduce emissions, and businesses are working to offset them or demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development goals. The bottom line is that until we have the commercialisation of planes that use other technologies to fly, business air travel via fossil-fuelled planes will decline. This, folks, is what they call the new normal.\nSo the world continues to turn. People need to connect, deals need to be made, ideas presented and strategies formed – but my goodness, there has to be a better way to get together than Zoom or Teams.\nSo, I don’t know about you, but this new normal, despite some advantages, could be seriously improved when it comes to connecting with others. So I decided to open the conversation here. What else can we do to communicate with each other apart from two-dimensional screens and earbuds to get us through the next decade?\nIn short: Virtual Reality. With rapidly accelerating connectivity, VR technology is looking increasingly strong. We at Ideas on Stage recently partnered with a VR firm using a headset to simulate rehearsals in front of a virtual audience with programmable responses. But this could go further in event participation, both as a presenter and as a participant. Consumer headsets such as Quest and Oculus-Go are not expensive, but prices rise quickly for more business-focused ones such as the HTC Vive Pro and Valve Index. Manufacturers are working to make these sets lighter year on year.\nApps/software that are appearing on the market to go with these things, like Spatial, Immersed, Glue and Engage to name a few, are offering some really cool experiences to get together in aesthetic environments with tactile tools to exchange and connect. For a relatively small investment and a manageable learning curve, every business professional can enter, I believe, into a more rewarding and intimate remote working structure. Not just for presenting but for collaboration and problem solving.\nAs I sit here and type this, I foresee great opportunities for this burgeoning market such as the desire to create made-to-measure virtual meeting landscapes and avatars. There are challenges too however such as compatibility over all platforms, a need for more sophisticated cybersecurity, the Segway factor (you can’t mix business and stupid avatars) and very importantly eye care. Working with a headset on all day will not be good for your eyes.\nOnline events and presentations will be transformed, and Zoom presentations, at least, will be a thing of the past. For presenters, content and delivery will always need to be on top form: as the experience improves, any sub-standard presentations will, by contrast, make an even worse impression than they do today. Technology always evolves faster than people do, so it will be up to presenters and meeting organizers to work hard to keep up and level up.\nAnd we will be there to help them.\nThat’s all for now: I have another Zoom meeting to go to…\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/03/30/2021-03-30-enough-with-presenting-on-zoom-already.en-copy/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Zoom"],"title":"Enough with Presenting On Zoom Already!"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means “a reason for being.” Ikigai is the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what you can be paid for and what the world needs.\nIf you ever want to speak at TED or TEDx event, you should find the ikigai of your presentation.

What you can be paid for, or in the case of TEDx, what you can be invited for. What the world needs, so that the topic reaches a wide audience.  It is fairly close, yet different, to the three stakes that you should have in any presentation (what matters to you, what matters to the audience, what matters to people outside).

After 4 exhausting years for America and the wider world, the page has turned from the failings of an introspective, corrosive and divisive mandate into a bold, courageous and reactive new era, acknowledging first the gravity of America’s collective problems and seeking to solve them through consensus and action.\nJoe Biden has his work cut out for him, that much is clear. Before doing anything however, he first needed to start it all off with the right speech. And on January 20th 2021, on the rear steps of the Capitol Building, President Biden gave an impassioned inaugural address to a domestic and overseas audience.\nAt Ideas on Stage, we have long worked with an understanding of audience segmentation based on 4 categories of people in your audience:\n Advocates, those who are already aligned with you and who will promote your cause, Luke-warms, those who are broadly supportive, but may harbor some skepticism Skeptics, those who are not convinced but are more or less open to being convinced Hostiles, those who will never be convinced, no matter what you say, and who will advocate against you and perhaps even aim to sabotage.  Let it be said that the aim of any persuasive speech is to bring the two middle groups of the luke-warms and skeptics on-side. Once you have the support of three out of the four groups, the hostiles will back down.\nIn this article I have chosen some passages that looked to win over the majority of Biden’s audience.\n “This is Americas Day, Democracy’s day, a day of history and hope, renewal and resolve.”\n This is for every citizen who recognizes America’s democracy and values the freedoms it stands for. It is worth noting that there are hostiles who do not believe in democracy.\n “We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. There is much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain.”\n This is designed to build momentum in those who recognize the perils and opportunities that surround them. The problem is then presented in no uncertain terms:\n “Few periods in our nation\u0026rsquo;s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u0026rsquo;re in now. A once in a century virus, taken lives, jobs lost, racial injustice, a cry of survival from the planet and white supremacy…”\n He then moves to the elusive solution:\n “Unity, Unity.”\n This points right at the heart of those who can put aside their differences and work for the country.\nTo help strike against doubt and demonstrate his commitment, Biden quotes Abraham Lincoln from the emancipation act quoting his words:\n “My whole soul is in it.”\n Biden goes on to say:\n “Today, on this January day, MY whole soul is in this: bringing America back together, uniting our people and uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause, uniting to fight the common foes we face, anger, resentment, hatred…”\n Powerful words again for advocates and skeptics alike. He then goes on to list the actions he will take to try to reverse the status quo, pushing collective empowerment, repairing alliances beyond America’s borders, again unity being the key word. His delivery is energized yet defiant.\n “Don’t tell me things can’t change.”\n He then has a word for the hostiles:\n “And if you disagree, so be it. That’s democracy, that’s America. Yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. I pledge this to you; I will be President to all Americans.”\n Biden then lists the common needs of all Americans and none more important than truth.\n “Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders — leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.”\n He then finishes on service:\n “I will give my all in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities.”\n Again, he looks to reassure his audience of his intentions and proceeds to congratulate every American who stood up for democratic principles, whatever their position on the aisle.\n “And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness.”\n The speech was received warmly both domestically and abroad. Anyone caring about the freedom of American democracy cannot fail to be moved by these words, whether you’re an advocate, a luke-warm or a harsh skeptic. The hostiles no doubt will count themselves out and return to the hateful shadows as they have done throughout history. Like germs in an organism constantly buffeting against an immune system, hostile actors can never be eradicated completely and serve in future to keep democracy’s defense systems on their guard.\nWednesday’s inauguration ceremony at times felt like the end of a war, watching America breathing a collective sigh of relief, releasing suppressed humanity and inclusion.\nThe struggles remain, however, but progress edges forward, collectively, painfully towards tackling America’s problems more effectively, together.\nBut there is nothing like a good speech to get it started off though!\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/01/26/2021-01-26-biden-s-inauguration-speech-reversing-american-carnage/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Biden’s Inauguration Speech: Reversing American Carnage"},{"author":"Marine Bénard","contents":"Zoom has become one of those tools that most people use, but how many of us have actually followed a training course on how to use Zoom properly? Not so many.\nAt Ideas on Stage we have been using Zoom for years, so when the 2020 pandemic hit, we didn’t discover Zoom, but we did start to discover new features: some that we hadn’t needed before, and some that Zoom introduced as its usage exploded.\nHere are some of the tips we’ve learned (often the hard way) on how to use Zoom professionally, and how to make online presentations using Zoom.\nBEFORE Set up parameters\nWhen you create your Zoom meeting, you have many parameters to choose from. For example, do you want to enable surveys? Do you want to enable live streaming to Facebook and/or YouTube?\nTwo of the most useful features are the waiting room, and automatically muting participants. If you don’t enable the waiting room, participants will just join at any time, and if you are running a webinar for example, you might want to allow participants in only after you’ve finished your testing. You may also choose, in this setting where there are many participants, to mute participants’ microphones automatically as they join; and in a separate setting, you can choose whether they have the ability to unmute their microphones.\nIf you are running a webinar, you will probably want to mute their mikes and not allow them to unmute them, to preserve sound quality. If, during the meeting, you would like to give a participant the opportunity to speak, you can go to the Participants list and ask the participant to unmute. Once you’ve requested it, they can activate their mike.\nThere are many other parameters to set. Do you want to automatically record the meeting? Should participants be allowed to share their screens, or annotate your shared screen? These are choices you need to make. Many of these settings are not in the ‘create meeting’ choices: they are in your account settings!\nPrepare surveys\nThere are many third-party tools to create surveys, but if you can use the one directly in Zoom, it’s easier for everyone. At the moment you can only create a survey in the web interface, so while you can do that during the meeting, it’s better to do so in advance. Simply go to the meeting page in your Meetings tab on the Zoom web site, scroll to the bottom, and add a survey.\nA real pro tip to remember here: when you launch a survey, display the questions and then display the results, these will show on your participants’ screens – but they won’t show up on YouTube if you are streaming live, so your streaming participants will be wondering what is happening unless you explain it orally very clearly.\nConfigure slides\nWhen streaming to YouTube, and (unless you change the setting) in your recording, if you share your screen, then your webcam video will be overlaid in the top-right corner of your screen. You should therefore avoid using this part of the screen because otherwise your face will hide some words or other content.\nIt’s also important to remember that on YouTube, Zoom will superimpose its watermark in the bottom-right of the screen, so it’s best to avoid using this part for anything important or text-based. Using the very bottom of the screen isn’t always good anyway, because anyone watching on YouTube and mousing-over the video window will find that their video controls will overlay over the bottom of the screen, hiding whatever is there.\nDURING Co-pilot / Mod\nAnyone who is familiar with streaming games on platforms like Twitch will know the importance of one or more ‘mods’ or ‘moderators’: people who aren’t speaking much if at all, but who are there to manage the participants, interact with them via text chat, and control or even expel them if necessary.\nIn business meetings, I prefer to call this role the ‘co-host, but it’s very similar. If you are the main presenter in a Zoom meeting, it’s very hard to speak and present well and at the same time manage recording, streaming, chat, muting or unmuting participant microphones, launching and hiding surveys, etc.\nIt’s therefore vital, in important meetings and webinars, to have a ‘co-host’ who can handle all these things, freeing you up to deliver your presentation with far less stress. Ensure that each ‘co-host’ is given this role (or the Host role) in Zoom so they have all the privileges to record the meeting, mute microphones, etc.\nSecond screen\nI have a home setup with my laptop screen and a second, external monitor next to it, and I extend my desktop so that, for example, I can move my mouse from one screen onto the next, and have different windows showing on each screen. This enables me to use PowerPoint with Presenter Mode, where I ‘project’ onto the second monitor, while seeing the time, my notes, the next slide etc. on my laptop screen.\nIn Zoom meetings, I can then simply share the second screen so participants see only what is on that screen. This enables me to show the Zoom chat window as well as other participants’ videos on my first screen even while presenting (currently this seems impossible in Microsoft Teams, where you can only see the video of the last person who spoke before you).\nIt’s a huge help. I couldn’t imagine presenting in a Zoom meeting with only one screen.\nSpotlight\nIt’s also very important, when one person is going to speak for some time, e.g. in a webinar, to ‘spotlight’ that speaker. This ensures that, by default, all participants will see that speaker’s video and not everybody else. It also ensures that on the video (if you are recording the meeting) that speaker should show up, and not the others.\nTo spotlight the speaker, a host or co-host simply goes to their name in the list of participants and clicks More, then Spotlight. The spotlight can be canceled in the same way.\nAFTER Edit recording\nIf you’re running a webinar, you probably don’t want to leave the raw video up there on YouTube. For one thing, you might not have the image rights from participants to share their voice and/or video online. You also might find that the intro, where you’re chatting with people while waiting for others to join, isn’t a great introduction to an online video.\nIt’s therefore wise to do some basic post-processing on your Zoom video. Hopefully you recorded the meeting locally, not on the ‘cloud’ (this gives better quality), so import this video file into your usual video-editing software, and cut the start and finish to make sure they look and sound right. You might also want to add an introduction card and another card at the end, so that when you upload your video to YouTube, you can overlay links to your other videos or playlists, and a subscribe button, at the end of your video – just as we have done on the video of this webinar.\nShare video\nIf you’re running an important meeting or webinar, you should also share the video with participants, including those who signed up but couldn’t attend. This gives you another opportunity to get your messages across, and since people forget much of what they hear quickly, it’s helpful to give them the chance to watch your meeting again.\nSharing the video also gives you a touchpoint with them so you can ask them for feedback, promote your upcoming webinars, or see whether they’d like to discuss with you one-to-one with a view to buying some services, for example.\nShare handout\nSlides are not documents, documents are not slides, and people forget most of what they hear in a meeting. It’s always important, therefore, to share a suitable document afterwards. For our webinar on Pro Tips for Zoom Meetings, this article is our handout. If you’re using Zoom for a business meeting, you may want to share a summary of the meeting and any decisions that were taken. If you’re using it for a training course, as we often do, you may want to share a detailed course workbook which gives them your full methodology, so they are not reliant on their memory if they need to apply your methods many months after your online course.\nThese are just some of the ‘pro tips’ we can share on using Zoom. Many of these are also valid in Teams or other platforms.

While this is fortunate and frankly would have been impossible 15 years ago it doesn’t come without its challenges.\nAs we struggle to maintain our routines, stay connected with our co-workers we have to continue the regular meetings attendance, trainings and webinars and we often have to give them ourselves. Online presenting is the new normal. From the conversations we’ve had with both our team members and our clients we’ve compiled a list of things to avoid when presenting online : a list of 7 sins. These 7 sins or not deadly, nor are they exhaustive. But it is a starting point in which we can make the experience of online presentations just that little bit less painful.\nSin Number 1 - Pointless Presentations Yes it’s true that pointless presentations hurt productivity in an office setting and online the hurt is no less painful. One question we can ask is, do we always need to be at every meeting? Here’s some numbers. In a large organisation the average employee can spend up to 10 hours per week in meetings, supervisors 15 hours. For senior managers the hours go up to 23 with nearly half of their week burnt up in meetings. About a third of that time is wasted on irrelevant conversations, meandering chit-chat and pointless presentations according to the MIT Sloan management review.\nNow, we’re not saying that meetings are bad, on the contrary, prepared and well organised meetings are empowering and good for community but too many meetings with pointless presentations kill morale and stifle productivity\nAt Amazon, they have a good approach to meetings which we call the 2/1/0 approach. 2 pizzas, 1 hard document and 0 PowerPoint. The pizza’s mean that no meeting should have more that the number of participants than two pizzas can feed. The singular document is distributed to every participate to read in silence for 10 minutes. The ensuing exchange will feature ZERO PPT slides. Ultimately, to choose between using PowerPoint badly, or not at all, you should leave the laptop closed. One controversial idea is to perhaps have less meetings and replace them with quiet time reading a document on your own, at one own pace. This would sit well with introverts for example.\nA good document should have 3 A’s. Autonomous, Accessible and Agreeable. Autonomous in the sense we do not need anyone to present it to us, it presents itself clearly with no corners cut on specifics and detail. Accessible means it should be divided into sections with a summary for quick navigation and Agreeable means it should be well designed with a consideration for colours, well-chosen fonts and visuals. Sin number 2 - Bad Slides Now most of us know how to do better slides today but for some reason, due to the emergence of many more online presentations, in my experience having attended as a jury member for many executive MBA and master’s programs, business pitch preparations, webinars and trainings, there is a tendency to want to go back to more traditional, heavy text presentations. This is a problem because the old issues of not being able to read and listen have gone away with video conferencing. The good news is that all our work with SCORE, Simple, Clear, Original, Related and Enjoyable still applies. Please check out our webinar on how to design great slides for online presentations. Sin number 3 - Disorganised Presenter So, imagine if I were to begin a webinar, log on 5 minutes late, in a dressing gown, so camera off, attempting to begin on mute only to be kicked off due to my bad WIFI? It happens more often than not. Working from home has its dangers so don’t allow ill-discipline to blight your work. Get on 15 minutes early, check your WIFI is working properly, your camera and sound. Get familiar also with your platform. There are many and due to various security issues companies are in constant flux about which ones to use. Sin number 4 - Background Image Filters It’s true, we can’t always be presenting from a beautifully designed room but throwing up a background image of something that is not remotely related to your task can be a visual distraction. Also, the filters don’t like erratic movement which causes outline issues. If you are regularly giving webinars Its better to invest in a real decor screen or otherwise a green which will give you a better definition when using a background. Just choose it to go with the context.\nSin Number 5 - Poor Interaction Keeping people engaged in online settings is even harder than in a live context so interaction is key. Imagine giving a 2-hour uninterrupted lecture on Zoom? People would be sleeping! That’s why structure is very important. Structure the webinar in advance. Variate activities and plan for time in working groups for collaboration. Also think about the kinds of activities you can introduce once the group is assembled such as quizzes, surveys and competition. This all helps to keep people engaged and ultimately learning. Sin Number 6 – Low Presenter Energy Monotony and online don’t mix. It’s a boredom cocktail. And in the words of Doctor John Medina, the author of Brain Rules, ‘The brain doesn’t pay attention to boring things’. You need to present like a radio host with lots of vocal animation and interaction. Give more energy than you think you need like a Youtube presenter gives 110% of their energy. Use the camera and look into the lens, articulate 110% and make sure your breath is well supported. Sin Number 7 – Bad Audience Now it might seem a little surprising here, but I wanted to shift the focus to badly behaved audiences. The people who never switch their camera on in business meetings, webinar attendees who don’t mute themselves, those who are clearly not paying attention and doing something else (careful you might get a question). Try to remain attentive (it’s hard enough for a host keeping the energy up via a screen) and watch out for home deliveries where you have to leave for several minutes and you miss something. So there you have it. 7 sins we’ve encountered with the heavy disruption of taking business communication online. Keeping it virtuous in the virtual on a daily basis, one webinar at a time, to make it a more effective and less painful experience for everyone. We hope it was useful, don’t hesitate to send us your ideas.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/12/04/2020-12-17-the_seven_deadly_sins_of_online_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins of Online Presentations"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Many of us are starting to approach presentations in the right way, taking the time to fix our objectives, analyze the audience, study the context, put together some coherent arguments, good visuals and even find the time to rehearse.\nJust as we are now spending longer to prepare our presentations properly, in a world of ever-increasing social media and ever-dwindling attention spans, our presentations are getting shorter in order to be more effective. What this means is that the inevitable question and answer interaction that follows is now more important than ever, yet we still don’t spend enough time preparing the Q\u0026amp;A session.\nIn this short article I would like to share with you 3 steps to Mastering Q\u0026amp;A: The Groundwork, The Message and The Dance.\nThe Groundwork At Ideas on Stage, when preparing presentations, we recommend that presenters begin with an ABC and analyze 3 things: the Audience, their Burning Needs and the Context of the presentation and its audience. This is a tried and tested approach to building solid foundations for the presentation and will also help you to produce the key messages and transformative objectives that you will also need to prepare your Q\u0026amp;A session. One thing that is necessary for your preparation is thorough research to feel confident in your answers. Prepare a list of the questions that are worrying you the most, and above all check the facts so you are thoroughly prepared. Your credibility on how well you cope with answering questions, so do the groundwork and lay solid foundations.\nThe Message The definition of a message is a one-sentence statement that incorporates two things: one of your most important points and one of your audience’s most important issues or values. An example here would be ‘Ideas on Stage has a decade of experience helping entrepreneurs to find the right formula to raise capital in a very competitive environment’. Something thing that sells us, and something that matters to them.\nFor entrepreneurs and small companies, it is reasonably straightforward to be in control of messaging but if we are part of a large organization where we are not permitted to say anything we want, many contextual aspects need to be taken into consideration such as hierarchy. That is why we use something we call the Traffic Light Technique. It’s a way to filter our messages between the ‘imperative messages’ (green), the ‘nice to have messages’ (amber/orange), and messages to avoid (red), as we take into consideration the structural hierarchy and risks that could undermine the organization as a whole.\nThe Dance This part of the process focuses on the soft skills of Q\u0026amp;A. Like in presenting, where we focus on direct audience contact and pressure, Q\u0026amp;A too comes with stress and risk.\nThe most important thing to remember is that it is your show, you decide when the questions start, you decide when they end and you choose the questioner each time.\nWhen choosing a questioner and giving them the floor, be mindful of some important things:\n1. First, listen actively, empty your cup of pre-emptive answers and listen to the questioner.\n2. Look for the meaning behind long and rambling questions by focusing on the cues in language such as the nouns and the verbs that they are using, all the while giving visual listening cues such as head nodding and showing engagement.\n3. Once you’re really sure of having understood the question, go ahead and answer. If there is still any doubt, you can paraphrase the question back to the questioner to seek their agreement to the question they’ve just asked.\n4. Whatever happens, always try to answer the question: avoiding answers doesn’t look good. You don’t want to be compared to a bad politician. Simply try to avoid any of the ‘red’ messages you identified, and aim to get across at least one of your ‘green’ messages in each answer. If you aren’t able to answer the question there and then, it’s best to admit it, and promise to get back to the questioner with an answer later. Nobody will want you to waste their time with a rambling statement that doesn’t answer the question.\nAccountability and transparency are highly valued by most business leaders, so practice your Q\u0026amp;A before the session to ensure you satisfy your audience and remove any doubt about your presentation.\nQ\u0026amp;A doesn’t have to be something that you don’t control. Take control and flourish as you finish the meeting as professionally as you started it.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/11/20/2020-12-21-how_to_master_q_a_sessions/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"How to Master Q\u0026A Sessions"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"A battle still rages for hearts and minds in the city built on speeches. Let the US election of 2020 be a lesson to all leaders of tomorrow.\nI am a frequent visitor to Washington DC. Having a key client on Pennsylvania Avenue, I have had the pleasure of getting to know the city and its people, working the day and socializing the night, breathing the atmosphere and drinking its politics. Washington DC is a city built on inspiration; it is built on speeches. There is a litany of references: Martin Luther King’s 1963 ‘I have a dream’ speech, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s inauguration (‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself’) and Ronald Reagan’s Challenger disaster speech… the list goes on. There are hundreds.\nRight now, in Washington, in November 2020, a battle rages.\nOn November 2nd, the United States went to the polls to elect a new president, and since then much of the world has been on the edge of its seat. At the time of writing, Joe Biden appears to be on his way to the White House, but the outgoing President Trump is not accepting his loss.\nI’d like to touch on two important speeches we’ve heard from these candidates: the acceptance speech given by the President Elect on Saturday November 7th, and a press conference given by the incumbent on Thursday 5th.\nFirstly, let’s look at Trump’s speech. On the Thursday after election night, and after briefings from his top advisers, Donald Trump took the decision to double down on the integrity of the vote. In the words of many of the covering networks, “He had sunk to a new low.”\nDuring the address, the President’s delivery style was firm and indignant, rebuking the result. For anyone who is ignorant of more than two centuries of elections in the US, this could perhaps be a convincing display as most people will not take a closer look at the detail. But reading through the transcript there are deeply unsettling elements. He began starkly with the accusation that his opponents were trying to steal the election, and what followed was a staggering slew of falsehoods that had some seasoned media pundits at the time of broadcast in tears. In the canon of presidential addresses, it will go down as one of the most toxic pieces of discourse ever given by an occupant of the Oval Office. A dystopian medley of projection, conspiracy and confusion, a nit-picking of grievances and alternative facts. Any audience listening to this, whether for or against this candidate, is left feeling triggered, troubled and weary. The objectives: to cast doubt, to destabilize and to discredit.\nFor many supporters of Joe Biden and the sober Trump voters looking for certainty, Biden’s acceptance speech provided some tonic.\nFirstly, by recognizing the presence of personal friends and family, he then widened the lens to the rest of the country, and within minutes he spoke of unity, of bringing together opposing sides, of improving America’s international image and championing the people who will help him in realizing his vision. His delivery was lively and animated, looking and sounding like a man younger than his 77 years. “Let’s give each other a chance,” he told Trump’s supporters. Decency, fairness and science were words he highlighted.\nThis is a world away from the list of Trump’s personal grievances. It’s a fundamentally non-violent, optimistic tone, seeking to calm and heal its audience, channeling partly Obama and partly Reagan, and for those who wish to see the country united rather than divided, this is a welcome return to the America we knew before.\nAt a time when Covid-19 rages on with 10 million cases in the US alone, a change in tone won’t be enough, but it may help to create the conditions for Americans to work together to beat the pandemic.\nWhat about communication in business? Violent communication in all its forms will, over time, break the spirit and burn out the listener. Poor leadership in communication, inconsistency, threats, half-truths and bluffs will destroy trust in your teams and will alienate partners. Most business leaders know this, which is why every organization works hard to groom the right senior communicators. But Trump’s style will leave its mark on the world, and the tone of violent communication will trickle down through every organization and business for years to come.\nWhichever company or organization you work for, successful leadership empowers your system and its people. Let this battle of violent-non-violent communication be a lesson for all future leaders: inspire respect, not fear; foster connection, not division; and build your people up instead of burning them out.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-violent_communication_versus_non-violent_communication-_a_battle_still_rages_for_hearts_and_minds_in_the_city_built_on_speeches/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Violent Communication versus non-Violent Communication"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"If you ever talked with me about my favorite TEDx talks, then I am sure I mentioned the late Hans Rösling, one of my all-time favorite TED speakers. On paper, he didn’t really start with an advantage; he spoke English with a strong foreign accent, and his key topic was statistics and demographics, something most of us associate with good sleep, not with great presentations.\nYet, Hans’ enthusiasm and passion on stage, combined with his unique way to use numbers to tell meaningful stories, meant that his presentations were always a high point of any TED conference.\nHowever, few people know that everyone can use the same tools as Hans Rösling for free. They are available on the gapminder.org website, and all you need to do to use them in a presentation is to give proper attribution. For example, I recently used gapminder.org to create a map of the world showing how the population living in cities doubled in the last forty years. Saying a number is one thing, but being able to see that number as a clear animated infographic is much more efficient.\nGapminder.org is going to give you the initial material, the starting point: the data and the animated infographics. But Hans’ killer skill apart from other statisticians is how he used data to tell meaningful stories.\n Hans’ secret was that he didn’t talk about numbers, he used number to illustrate the stories he told.\n Take for example his fantastic talk about the evolution of India and China. He is not showing historical data about China and India (and the rest of the world). What he actually does is tell the story of how key historical events and the march towards sovereignty of these countries affected their development. Check in particular how he ironically talks about China’s great leap forward with central planning, and you actually see a huge drop in life expectancy.\n Among Hans’ other skills: setting up the context to make sure that people have the necessary information to understand his story. He takes time to explain the historical context, and takes great care to explain the meaning of each element of his graph: each axis, the bubbles, the year, etc.\nHans is so popular that TED has a list of his best talks on their website. If you work for a large organization such as the World Bank, the AFD or the OECD, I highly recommend that you steal some of Hans’ magic.\nImage : CC BY 2.0, Pierre Omidyar, Wikipedia\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/10/20/2020-10-20-unleash-the-hans-ro%CC%88sling-in-you/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"Unleash the Hans Rösling in You"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Some people think that to make a great TEDx presentation, they should learn their text by heart. Our collective experience as coaches shows that it’s a good solution only IF:\n You like to know your speech word for word and it fits your personal style and you know how to do it properly.  If you don’t meet one of these conditions, then it’s best to avoid learning your text by heart. Why? Because it will appear awkward, unnatural or insincere. Reciting a text from memory requires a lot of effort, often at the expense of naturalness and emotion. To keep people close to your heart, don’t learn by heart.\nBut why if you want to do it anyway? Our advice is to learn it to perfection. You must practice until you can recite the text without having to think; only then will your brain be free to connect with the audience and express emotion again. Doing so takes a lot of time; the speakers who learn a text by heart and deliver it successfully on stage spend up to 40 hours just rehearsing.\nThe alternative we recommend for most speakers is to perfectly memorize the key points of the storyline, and use improvised, natural sentences instead of pre-learned ones. It is a much more accessible approach which delivers great results. You will still need to spend time rehearsing, but much less than if you tried to learn everything by heart.\nOf course, there is an exception. Sometimes, it’s absolutely necessary to say something exactly as it was prepared. It may be a very important statement in a public relations setting, a famous quote, or key marketing messages. In that case you should take the time to memorize those lines word for word.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020-10-06-should-i-learn-a-presentation-by-heart/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"To learn or not to learn your speech by heart"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Many speakers tend to rush the start of their presentation. During conferences and events, they start to speak even before they put a foot on the stage, talking as they walk towards the center, or as soon as the master of ceremonies stops to speak. It makes them look as if they think they are suffering from the “imposter” syndrome, insecure and unsure that they should be speaking on stage.\nConfident leaders act differently. They take the time to gain “ownership” of the stage. They enter the stage, fast or slow depending on their style. They use eye contact and body language to build a relationship with the audience. They take the time to position themselves in the centre, they take the time to breathe, and only then they start to speak. In other words, as true leaders do, they dictate the pace. Powerful people only speak when they are ready and on their terms.\nTaking your time before you start speaking will help you build more stage presence and avoid one of the most common pitfalls which is to start your delivery before establishing a proper connection with the public.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020-09-01-dont-rush-your-start/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Don’t rush your start"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Do animations in a presentation make you feel seasick?

Before, during and after the meeting, the facilitator’s role is key to ensure harmony, allow each participant to contribute, and achieve the meeting’s objectives.\nThe role will depend on the type of meeting. For a webinar, the facilitator will need to focus on sound quality, ensuring those not speaking have muted their microphones (or doing it for them), and handling the text chat. For a decision or collaboration meeting, the facilitator will need to ensure everyone has the chance to speak and be heard, focus on the meeting’s objectives, and keep a careful eye on the time.\nThere are several key responsibilities that the facilitator needs to cover, before, during and after online meetings. They may delegate some tasks to others, or they may decide certain tasks are unnecessary, but that should be a conscious decision, not an omission. Here is an overview.\nBEFORE\n TECHNICAL SET-UP: This means booking the meeting using Zoom, Teams, Hangouts or whichever system you choose to use, configuring it appropriately for this meeting, and ensuring participants have the sign-in details. ATTENDANCE: The most important task of any facilitator is to ensure all the right people attend the meeting. This means sending the invitation well in advance, sending a reminder a day or two before the meeting, and ensuring all participants are aware their participation is required, not just optional. PRE-READ: Remembering that we use documents for information and slides for attention (Revolution #4), it may be helpful to share some information in a standalone document before the meeting. If you are not going to allow time during the meeting for participants to read the document, you should also make it clear that they are expected to read it in advance. Pro-tip: send them another invitation for a 15-minute slot before the meeting so they have time blocked to read the document, and a reminder to do so. SLIDES: Even if nobody needs to give a presentation (and you should avoid presentations in online meetings unless they are the best way to achieve an objective), you may find it is helpful to use some ‘structure’ slides to remind people of the agenda regularly, to ensure nobody feels lost during the meeting. You might have the agenda engraved in your mind, but most participants will not, so sharing that regularly can be helpful for them.  DURING\n TIMEKEEPING: Meetings should not overrun. State at the beginning that you are (or a designated colleague is) the timekeeper for the meeting, and that person will need to keep things on track, stop people if they are speaking for too long, and do what it takes to ensure the meeting finishes on time. This will make people feel less unhappy about being interrupted because everyone likes meetings to finish on time. INTERACTION: Most online meeting systems have a Chat function, and the facilitator should keep it open to respond quickly to anyone asking questions or making comments. It’s also possible to use it to chat privately with individuals, which may sometimes be helpful. The facilitator may also be the one to handle polling questions, and mute participants who fail to do it themselves. Most importantly, except in a webcast or webinar situation, the facilitator should ensure everyone who needs to speak has a chance to be heard, focusing especially on less assertive participants and inviting them to speak, rather than letting the usual loudmouths dominate the discussion. In particular, a good facilitator should not impose their own views: it’s therefore often best to choose a ‘neutral’facilitator who can focus on gathering everyone else’s opinion rather than trying to convince everyone to accept their own views. OBJECTIVES: The facilitator should always keep the meeting objectives in mind. This may mean bringing the conversation back on topic if it goes off on a tangent, and reminding participants regularly about the objectives and the planned agenda. Finally, the facilitator should ensure the meeting concludes with a summary of what was decided (if it was a decision meeting), or the key messages (if it was a webinar), or the main outcomes (if it was a team or collaboration meeting) – and in all cases, what the next steps are, if any.  AFTER\n SUMMARY: The facilitator’s role does not end when the meeting concludes. In most situations, the facilitator should send some kind of summary to participants and to other interested parties, explaining what was said, what was decided, and what happens next. When it comes to decision or collaboration meetings, this has the added benefit of allowing people who are interested in the outcome, but not required in the meeting, to skip the meeting while still staying in the loop. This makes them more productive, and this kind of meeting will run better with fewer participants, so everyone wins. Even in a webcast or webinar, participants will likely forget what was said quickly, and sending slides is of no help to anyone, so a simple summary document – like this one, written to follow our 5th Virtual Meeting Revolution webinar – can be very helpful for participants.  Based on these important responsibilities, several points will doubtless become clear to you:\n Most online meetings don’t have facilitators - and that’s one reason they fail. It’s most helpful when the facilitator isn’t the one doing most of the speaking. If you are speaking in a webinar, and sharing your slides, it’s hard to check the chat, activate surveys and keep an eye on the time as well. Physical meetings should also have a facilitator - not necessarily the most senior person present, but someone empowered to lead the meeting properly. Being a good facilitator is not easy: it’s an important role, which takes time and effort, and a good knowledge of the virtual meeting technology you are using: the facilitator is also real-time technical support to participants.  Before 2020, I was often on stage in the role of Master of Ceremonies at conferences, performing a similar role. In the post-Covid-19 world, I’m expecting the role of Online Master of Ceremonies to keep me just as busy, as companies realise that they need a specialist to handle this role for important online meetings and conferences.

PowerPoint isn’t the problem - it’s how people (mis)use it.\nIn fact most business meetings would do well to avoid slides - and presentations - altogether. Meetings should be for discussion, connection, decisions… not for information-sharing. Using a wonderfully-crafted PowerPoint deck to share information is like using an iPad Pro as a frisbee: sure, it’s well-designed and better than most other tablets, but it’s still the wrong tool for the job. Just give people a document with full sentences, and time to read it. Far more effective.\nWhen it comes to online meetings, however, slides can be especially useful. Virtual Meeting Revolution #4 states: Use documents for information, slides for attention.\nFirst of all, this means you should use a real document to share any information the participants need. You might summarize some key points in some slides to show during the meeting, but this should just be a reminder, not the main source of information. Showing stuff in bullet-points during a meeting is not a“proof of communication”: it’s evidence of poor communication unless the information was shared properly elsewhere.\nSo what do you use slides for? Attention. Gaining participants’ attention, keeping it, and directing it.\nThe usual slide success criteria apply, so we can borrow these from our bestselling Business Presentation Revolution course:\n SIMPLE: One simple question or message per slide, easy to understand in five seconds CLEAR: Every element on your slide is easy to read/see at the back of the room ORIGINAL: Stand out, be different, and make people feel a sense of discovery with every click RELATED: Your slide must be related to what you are saying right then - not before or after ENJOYABLE: Well prepared, pleasant to look at, and worthy of your company’s visual identity  In fact, they are even more important in online meetings. If slides are for attention, then they are vital because it’s very hard to keep people’s attention when you can’t see them, and they know you can’t see them. (Video meetings are great but too many people don’t switch on their video, and when you’re sharing your screen/slides, usually you can’t see everyone. And they know that.)\nThis means that you need to make an extra effort to make your slides Original and Enjoyable. If people like what they see, and get an emotional reaction from it, they will be less likely to switch their attention to something else. And ensure everything is Clear: they may not be sitting a long way from the screen like in a physical meeting room, but they might be watching on their smartphone, so if your text or numbers aren’t clear on a phone-sized screen, they’re not clear enough.\nThere are some additional points to bear in mind, though, which are specific to online meetings. Here are three things to avoid, and three things to use in virtual meetings.\n AVOID TRANSITIONS AND ANIMATIONS: Even a basic dissolve transition does not always look good in online meetings where the screen refresh rate is not as good as it is on your own screen. By all means have things appear at the right time on your slide using the Animation function in PowerPoint, but only use the Appear animation so the participants don’t see a failed attempt at movement, or zooming, or fading (and definitely no bouncing). AVOID SOUNDS AND VIDEOS: For the same reason of poor screen refresh rate, and the added reason of sound quality issues, avoid showing videos in online meetings. They’re great if you’re in the same room (although I usually avoid video if the room uses ClickShare which also suffers from the refresh rate issue, meaning video seems jerky), but not good online. Don’t use sound effects either. Also, this should go without saying, but please: no animated GIFs! AVOID GRADIENTS: Gradient backgrounds can look very good on your screen: this is where the background fades from one color at the top of the screen to another at the bottom, for example. When you share your screen online, what the participants see is often a lower-resolution version of your slides, with lower color definition. This means that what you see as a smooth gradient may be seen by others as a series of horizontal bands. It doesn’t look nearly as good. Best to avoid gradients in online meetings. USE STRUCTURE SLIDES: It’s important to use your slides to ensure participants are not lost. Let’s be honest, some people might get distracted by an important email, or phone call, or child, and miss a few minutes of your meeting. Don’t let them get lost. Ensure that you regularly show a slide that gives participants the meeting agenda or structure, and highlights where you are now. Even if you’re just sharing the agenda and then discussing for 15 minutes without advancing the slide, this can be useful: it’s the equivalent of having the agenda on a flip-chart in a physical meeting room, and it can help to focus participants’ attention. USE ANNOTATIONS: You can’t use a laser to point to a part of your slide as you would in a meeting room, but there are even better tools available. You can use the native PowerPoint tools to highlight things, outline them etc, and some online systems like Zoom also give the presenter some controls to use a highlighting function. Experiment with them to see what works for you. USE VISUAL PAUSES: We love black slides so much we call them The World’s Best Slide. In a face-to-face presentation, just inserting a simple black slide is like a visual pause, as if the screen or projector is temporarily switched off and the audience can focus right back on the speaker. You don’t always need a slide to illustrate what you are saying. However, in an online meeting, if you show a pure black screen, people will think there’s a technical problem. You may choose instead to use a mostly blank slide with just your logo in the center. Or you could simply pause your screen sharing so people see you speaking instead of your slides, until you need the slides again. After all, the most important visual of all is you, with your expressions and gestures.  Always remember that slides are there to illustrate what you are saying, and to make it clearer, more meaningful and more memorable to the audience. You aren’t there to comment on slides, so always work out what to say before you think how you might illustrate it - if you need illustrations at all.\nIt’s only the meeting that’s supposed to be virtual; if their attention is virtual too, your meeting is probably just a waste of time. So we hope that if you follow this advice, you’ll be able to communicate effectively, and keep your audience’s attention throughout your online meetings.\nIf you need help producing effective slides for your online meetings or presentations, contact us using the form below, and our experienced PowerPoint designers will be happy to hear from you.\n  ","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/04/10/2020-04-10-how_to_use_slides_effectively_in_online_meetings/","summary":"","tags":["Remote","Meetings","Slides","SlideDeck","Virtual Meeting"],"title":"How to use slides effectively in online meetings"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"As many of us are learning, it’s easy to arrange a virtual meeting, but not so easy to run one successfully. There is quite a steep learning curve.\nOne vital area to work on is speaking in virtual meetings. People often complain of video issues, microphone issues, poor vocal expression, monotonous speakers, and poor interactivity. Step 5 of our Virtual Meeting Revolution process is called Connection for a good reason: when speaking in an online meeting, you need to connect with the other participants, and you can’t connect if they are so bored they are not paying attention, or if they gave up trying to understand what you are saying.\nBeing an engaging speaker in an online meeting requires three main elements:\nComfort: preparing yourself and your setup so you feel serene and fully focused, ready to give the participants and their questions your full attention\nPassion: speaking with energy so that people are engaged, and want to keep\nVariation: using your voice to engage instead of bore the other participants\nLet’s take a look at each of these elements.\nComfort If you seem comfortable, the other participants will feel you are in control, and this makes it more pleasant for them to listen to you. Nobody listens to a speaker who seems uneasy, agitated or poorly prepared.\nSeeming comfortable is good. Feeling comfortable is even better.\nStrong preparation before the meeting will help you to feel comfortable. This includes rehearsing any presentations aloud and timing yourself to ensure your meeting doesn’t overrun, and checking that your network, microphone and camera are working, and you have more than enough battery for your PC.\nAlso, the chairperson and any presenters should avoid coffee: it increases anxiety and will speed up your vocal delivery while drying your mouth and throat. A glass of water is your friend; just don’t spill it on your computer!\nNext, here are some tips to appear more comfortable.\nIf you can, try to speak in a standing position: this is good for your breath and the clarity of your voice, and it gives you more energy and freedom to use gestures. You’ll seem more in control – as long as you stand still.\nAdjust your camera location and angle so your eyes are two-thirds up the screen, whether you’re sitting or standing, and try to ensure the camera is more or less at eye-level. During my recent Virtual Speaking Success webinar (see replay below), I chose to sit down because in my home setup it wasn’t easy to get the camera at the right height for me to stand. Sometimes that’s a limitation you have to live with, so get used to speaking in either posture.\nTry to look into the lens as much as possible. To make this easier, if the technology allows, you could reduce the number of participant video windows so that you only see the active speaker, and you can reduce the size of that active video and move it to the top of the screen just underneath your webcam.\nPassion Boredom is contagious; luckily, so is passion. As chairperson or speaker in an online meeting, you are like a radio host. So how do you capture the passion and energy of a radio host? The first and most important thing to do is to keep the meeting objective in mind, and visibly care about reaching it.\nPassion also needs engagement from the presenter or chairperson, answering questions and keeping people’s needs constantly in mind.\nAnd finally, passion needs positive emotions: smiles and animated facial expressions help to keep people engaged. While minimal hand gestures are useful, they won’t always be visible on camera, so the main gestures to use are facial expressions (affect displays). If you look bored or seem like you don’t care, don’t expect anyone else to care either.\nVariation The most important element to chairing and presenting in virtual meetings is your voice. Monotony kills attention. So do overly long sentences. Keep sentences short, and finish each sentence on a downward inflection or tone, with a pause, so it’s clear the sentence is finished.\nTo avoid sounding monotonous, you can vary your speed, your tone, your volume and your emotion, even within each sentence. You might also consider trying out the Four Tempos of Vocal Impact:\n Bright (short vowels and light vocal intention) Human (long vowels and light vocal intention) Bold (short vowels and Strong vocal intention) Captivating (long vowels and Strong vocal intention)  By experimenting with these tempos, you can vary the way you deliver. A recent example is from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: when he’s aiming to calm and reassure his citizens he uses the Bright and Human tempos, and when he is criticizing others and defending himself he uses the Bold and Captivating Tempos.\nYou can hear examples of these Four Tempos in our Virtual Speaking Success webinar (see below).\nTo sum up:\nCreate your Comfort zone with good preparation, and check your equipment and environment. Avoid coffee if you need to speak, and look into the lens to maintain eye contact with online participants.\nDiscover your Passion by adopting a Radio Host style, connecting to your objective, showing you care, and interacting regularly with participants to maintain their attention.\nBuild Variation into the way you speak, and shorten your sentences.\nYou can find more details on speaking in virtual meetings in the webinar below, and if you find this useful, check out our other* Virtual Meeting Revolution webinars* and don’t hesitate to contact us if you’d like help to prepare your next online meeting or presentation.\n  ","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/04/06/2020-04-06-virtual_speaking_success_effective_communication_in_online_meetings/","summary":"","tags":["Meeting","Remote","Virtual Meeting Revolution","Public Speaking"],"title":"Virtual Speaking Success: Effective communication in online meetings"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"What are you going to do today? For many typical office workers, the answer is: too many meetings, and not enough time to work. It’s rare that meetings and productivity coincide.\nAt the time of writing, many of us are required to work from home, so physical meetings have become virtual meetings, and they’re not always an improvement. Online meetings present their own set of challenges, principally because unless everyone has their camera switched on, one participant won’t know whether another is paying attention, or is checking Instagram, or has gone to walk his dog, aiming to return at the end of the meeting in time to say goodbye and pick up as few actions as possible.\nSo here are the 5 main revolutions our virtual meetings need to become real successes:\n1. Match the people with the purpose.\nEnsure the right people are there to achieve your purpose - and only the right people - while ensuring your stated purpose suits the people. Sometimes you’ll choose the meeting objective based on the people who should attend - for example a defined team - and sometimes you’ll choose the participants based on the objective. Always first understand the context, and then ensure the people match the purpose.\n2. Don’t pollute meetings with unnecessary presentations.\nOf course, at Ideas on Stage, we live and breathe presentations - but we’ll be the first to say when you shouldn’t be presenting. We like the Jeff Bezos approach: in a meeting aimed at decision or collaboration, there should never be any presentations. Not just no slides, but no presentations. Give people a document to read that includes any information they need, then focus the time on discussion and interaction, with strong facilitation (see #5). If you’re giving a webinar or webcast, that’s when a presentation can work well. In other meetings, plan to spend time on the other possible ingredients of a successful meeting: discussion, interaction, brainstorming and quiet reading (see #4), and only use short presentations when necessary.\n3. Aim for attention and interaction.\nAttention is the currency of leaders - and in online meetings, it is all too rare. Plan your virtual meeting to ensure people can find nothing more interesting to do… because the meeting is the most interesting thing they could do. It’s not up to the participants to make an effort to pay attention: it’s up to the meeting leader, facilitator and any presenters to make an effort to deserve their attention at all times. Planning for interaction is a great way to keep people engaged.\n4. Use documents for information, slides for attention.\nPeople forget what they hear very quickly. They remember far more from what they read - as long as they are allowed to focus on reading, without disturbances. This is why Bezos has everyone read a 6-page document in silence at the start of a meeting. By the time everyone has finished, they are literally on the same page - and can then discuss and take decisions. In an online meeting, it’s also a good idea to share documents your participants can read - even if it means they are reading in silence during the first ten minutes of the meeting. At first it seems odd, but it’s extremely efficient. Where you decide to use slides, ensure they are aimed at keeping or focusing everyone’s attention rather than delivering information.\n5. Facilitate online meetings - before, during, and after.\nA meeting without a facilitator is like an orchestra without a conductor: a lot of talented people making an awful noise. The facilitator may not - and ideally should not - speak for more than half of the time, unless they are also the main presenter in a webinar or webcast. But their role is key. Before the meeting, the facilitator sets the meeting purpose, invites the right people, reminds them, sets up the technology for the meeting, prepares and shares any pre-read documents, and plans the meeting agenda, remembering the first 4 revolutions. During the meeting, the facilitator keeps time – or assigns someone else to be the timekeeper – while ensuring everyone has a chance to contribute, making the agenda flow, and ensuring the meeting objectives are reached. It’s also very important for the facilitator, and any other speakers, to speak clearly and engagingly, so everybody wants to listen and can easily understand. After the meeting, the facilitator should ensure proper meeting minutes or outcomes are shared with participants as well as stakeholders, so that even people who weren’t there will know what happened and what was decided. (This means people won’t feel compelled to attend just to stay in the loop – and fewer participants make for a more productive meeting.)\nThere is much we can improve about virtual meetings, and we have 5 webinars on the subject - our first webinar is live on YouTube - all of which are simply a condensed version of what we have to share in our Virtual Meeting Revolution course.

Color me shocked, but his is talk about the power of colors is full of interesting details.\n  In fourth place is Maïa Mazaurette.

How do we do it at Ideas on Stage?\nFrom day one, Ideas on Stage was created as a digital company. In fact, for many years, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a physical office. Even today, we strongly encourage our employees to work remotely and limit their travel to what\u0026rsquo;s necessary. We can deliver 90% of our services at distance to our clients, whether it\u0026rsquo;s the creation of a presentation, coaching or training. I think that what we learned in ten years of remote work may be useful to other companies who are not used to this type of organization, and this is what I\u0026rsquo;d like to share in this article.\nThe key success factor: autonomous employees Let me say this immediately: remote work does not suit everyone. My personal observation is that successful remote employees all share a common quality: autonomy. Successful remote employees are autonomous, self-starters. They are the diamonds of a remote work environment.\nProcrastinators, people who need a daily kick in the butt to get things done, will struggle in a result-oriented work environment, but can still succeed with active supervision. Employees who always find excuses for everything, try to avoid responsibilities and rely on others to get their own work done are the least efficient when working remotely. But honestly, they were never that efficient.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about the result, not the number of hours Measuring the performance of remote employees based on number of hours worked is only possible using permanent surveillance, à la Big Brother. There are even tools that check how often the employee moves his mouse and types on his keyboard! I call that measure of performance HSOYA: Hours Sitting On Your Ass. A successful remote work environment measures mainly one thing: work done, in quantity and quality.\nClear deliverables A result oriented work environment brings us to the next logical success factor: clear deliverables for each team member. Each team member knows the deliverables he is responsible for, its boundaries and the deadline. Large deliverables should be broken down into smaller ones that never take longer than a couple of days to complete.\nAn adaptable organisation As a CEO of a company or the head of a department with remote workers, keeping a traditional, top-down organization is the surest way to spend ten hours a day doing video calls. In a remote work environment, the bottlenecks of a top-down, highly hierarchical environment becomes even more apparent: it just holds everything back.\nInstead, I think that a high level of adaptability in the organization works best. Instead of being stuck in a rigid organization chart, individuals freely assemble themselves into teams and task forces based on their skills and availability to work on the deliverables.\nAn unlock mechanism Autonomy is good, but it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to handle. Sometimes people can get lost or are unable to use their autonomy wisely. Conflicts can arise between people and project needs. In a decentralized system, work will not always be distributed evenly and fairly between team members. If not taken into account, it can give a feeling of unfair treatment to employees, foster resentment and bring projects to a halt. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s important to have procedures in place to raise and unlock these stress points quickly.\nTools Dropbox, Office 365, Email, Slack and Zoom are the core tools that we use to enable our decentralized work. Some of us also use Youcanbookme and Zapier. These tools are simple, but their use is not \u0026ldquo;obvious\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s important to get people to use them properly, and have someone in charge of the administration of each tool.\nRegular events Even if we work well remotely, having team events from time to time is important. We do two remote calls per week, one focused on sales, one focused on projects. We also have regular face to face meeting in our offices. Once a month, we meet to work on the development of the company, and once every quarter we have a bigger two-day event.\nConclusion: it\u0026rsquo;s easier than you think Adopting a remote work environment is easier than you think. Nowadays nearly all companies have digital tools. The biggest obstacle is psychological: moving from a top-down, rigid and high control organization to a decentralized, adaptable and results based organization requires a shift in mindset and practice. But if people are forced to stay home, moving to an efficient remote work organization will become a matter of survival for many companies and an opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/03/03/2020-03-03-how-we-deliver-our-services-remotely/","summary":"","tags":["Remote Work","Remote"],"title":"How we deliver our services remotely"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"A lot of people think that organizing an event is within everyone’s reach. But is it really true? If you want to organize one for your company, a lot is at stake, including brand reputation as well as the satisfaction of your customers or guests. If you don’t want to take any chances and make a positive impression, it’s important to set up a team dedicated to your project.\nIf you are the organizer in the hot seat, you are likely asking yourself many questions. Should I call a specialist or do the project internally? How do I make sure not to forget anything important? How do I manage the stress and additional work load? And the list goes on. To help you sort through the questions and challenges of planning a successful event, I interviewed Marine, our experienced and extremely efficient event manager, about the advantages of hiring an event coordinator.\nQ: Marine, why would someone hire an Event Manager? A: Hi Pierre! If the entire weight of the event rests on your shoulders, you will eventually reach the point of burnout. So, to minimize the physical and mental stress associated with leading an event, it is important to streamline roles and responsibilities and get comfortable with delegating most tasks across the team. That said, internal delegation only goes so far. Sometimes you need to bring in experience to ensure success.\nQ: Tell us more, which tasks could be offload**ed to an external event organizer? A: Well, you can start with your least favorite tasks! (laughs) Seriously, you are already juggling your everyday work demands. If someone else takes care of your least favorite tasks, you will be more able to focus on the big picture. Clients love that.\nQ: What about the coordination with other suppliers? A: Throughout the process, an event coordinator can be your trusted link with suppliers: no more calls from the caterer about how many napkins to provide; no more infinite to-do lists filling your day with secondary details. They can keep you updated on the progress of your event step-by-step and answer any questions you have along the way.\nQ: There are so many decisions to make when organizing an event. Can the coordinator help there? A: Of course. If you have never organized an event before, you may be feeling overwhelmed about where to start or how to make wise choices. A professional coordinator will have done this dozens of times before. I have worked on events across a wide variety of industries and can therefore guide clients through any and all decisions they need to make with more confidence than someone who is doing this as a one-off. We are used to multitasking and handling the spectrum of event challenges that inevitably arise.\nQ: Teams know their organizational culture best. So how can someone external help clients make an event memorable? A: It’s true external coordinators must partner with internal stakeholders to make an event meaningful. That said, our methodology of highlighting key messages, unifying them under a common theme and offering fresh ideas with an outside perspective has shown time and again to make a remarkable difference. We select and organize creative activities that infuse events with fun and memorable moments. After all, you want your team to remember an amazing event for what it meant to them and not just for the quality of the champagne.\nQ: Organizing an event can be stressful. How do you help our clients keep calm? A: Even if you have the time and experience, there is no denying that event management can be stressful. The risk, responsibilities, negotiations, and myriad other things to handle flood in. Having us by your side guarantees a lighter load and sweeter, smoother experience overall. We will ensure you don’t overextend yourself or your team. Creating an amazing event can be a wonderful experience, and it is our pride and pleasure to be sure you enjoy the process.\nThank you very much Marine for taking the time to share your perspective on how you have supported our events clients.\nIf you want to learn more about how to create an amazing event, here are our 12 tips.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/02/25/2020-02-25-why-should-i-hire-an-external-event-coordinator-an-experienced-event-manager-s-point-of-view/","summary":"","tags":["Events","Business Event","Project Management","Business"],"title":"Why should I hire an external event coordinator?

Looking at my script, I realized that many sentences could be simplified, some details omitted, and the structure streamlined.\nAfter several dry runs and rewrites, we finally managed to get the video down to 3 minutes. But this once again demonstrated that creating a good short video takes a lot more effort than creating a long one.\nThis is true for almost every TED, TEDx or Keynote presentation. It’s very unusual to have to lengthen a speech. Most of the time, we have to cut it down to get to the core of the message and to avoid exceeding the maximum time allowed. Rambling is cheap, conciseness precious.\nThe next time you prepare a presentation, ask yourself: when was the last time your audience wished it was longer? What can I remove? What can I simplify? Instead of adding one more detail, remove what is not indispensable. Instead of trying to cram one more graph in the last blank square centimeter, remove everything that is not needed. This will greatly improve your presentation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/02/04/2020-02-04-if-you-want-to-be-brief-and-to-the-point-prepare/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"If you want to be brief and to the point, prepare"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Is there a perfect recipe for a successful presentation? No. Partly it depends on the audience and the context: a boardroom presentation shouldn’t look like a TED talk, even if the subject is the same. And different presentations at the same event – a conference, a demo day, an Executive Committee meeting – should also look different from each other, because otherwise none of them will stand out.\nSo if there is no magic formula, are there at least some key ingredients we should always include?\nOver the last ten years, I’ve given thousands of speakers countless pieces of advice on how to make their presentations resonate with their audiences. Finally, out of all these great tips and ideas, I’ve boiled it down to three magic ingredients. If you include these in your presentation, you’ll be well on the road to success.\nThese were the subject of my recent TEDx talk at TEDxSaclay. Perhaps you’d like to discover them live by watching this short video – or if not, scroll down to see a summary.\n  So let’s recap these three magic ingredients:\n The Audience – it’s their presentation, not yours, so personalize your presentation to suit your audience, their needs and their expectations, as well as their context. Bring them into the presentation and make it special for them, and they will listen attentively. The Speaker – even if it’s their presentation, it’s important for you to put something personal into it. If someone else could have delivered the exact same talk with the exact same words, then there’s nothing of you in there, and that matters because when you share, we care. So make it clear why you care, and tell them stories and examples from your experience to illustrate your key messages. Transformation – too many presentations aim only to inform their audience, and that fails because people forget most of what they hear very quickly. Presentations are best for transforming audiences: changing something in what they believe, feel and do. Always build your presentation around your transformational objectives.  In the second part of this TEDx talk, I showed the Ideas on Stage Audience Transformation Roadmap™, our simple but extremely powerful tool for setting these transformational objectives and brainstorming what to say, show and do to achieve them. This has been used thousands of times already in all kinds of situations, and not only for great presentations: also for event planning, proposal writing, preparing job interviews or even writing tough emails or press releases.\nThe Audience Transformation Roadmap works in any situation where you need to change what people believe, feel and/or do. Even better, we’ve shared it as part of our commitment to improving communication, using a Creative Commons license so you can use it without charge (as long as you don’t try to sell it as your own - simple conditions available here).\nIf you’d like to learn more about using the Audience Transformation Roadmap, or the three magic ingredients, or anything else about presentations; or if you’d like help to facilitate a brainstorming session; or if you’d like to invite me to speak to your teams about better business communication (in English or French), simply contact us using the form below.\nAnd if you liked this talk, please share it with your colleagues.

Yes, that one based upon a mash-up of some of your favorite TED speakers whom you are certain you’ll never be as good as. Well, forget it!\nWelcome to the Post-TED style of authenticity centered presentation.\nIn my last article, Wash that TED right out of your head: New Post-TED presentation, we explored some of the foundational reasons which many are experiencing, and what I call, “TED-like style Fatigue”. Please see that first, as it was the second in a series of three articles exploring this subject. However, if you already think you know what I mean by TED-like style fatigue, then by all means read on.\nSo, we have established that we are growing rather weary of the formulaic and “highly oratorial,” perfectly polished, and perfectly predictable TED-like style that we see time and time again. Fine. What comes after then?\nWhat follows as alluded to above are presentation and communication efforts that are more fully grounded in the authenticity of the speaker and front compassion for the audience over competition for likes and shares; while empathetically engaging with the audience by providing content in a more meaningful and fulfilling manner. More meaningful and fulfilling because with empathy as a brick in the backbone construction of your communication, you have put yourself in their shoes and taken off your boots of competition worn to crush the opponent and thereby, crush your communication as well.\nThere is no winning in a Post TED-like style world of presentations, because when you employ the structural architecture principles of Authenticity, Compassion, and Empathy as the new triumvirate for the 21st century, there will be no losers either.\nIn the old world of TED-like style presentations, the targeted focus message for the presentation was explaining and showing the “why” behind the subject matter. While explanation of the “why” is essential in all presentations, too many presenters put a singular focus not on the “why”, but on the “why is my presentation better than others,” and that does not work anymore in a world moving increasingly in a non-rivalrous direction. Thus exclusively “why” focused presentations can only be effective in a time where the cultural sense of cohesion is based upon exclusion and rarity. A society that is knitted together by the strategy of keeping difference out. Thus, the “why” or foundational motivation, your company, product, project, or idea is better than anyone else’s only works well in a world used to being separated into classes of winners and losers.\nThankfully, many have begun to see the vapidity of this world view; and are increasingly rejecting presentations and communication efforts forged from the rusted constructive remains of this broken technology.\nIt is no wonder that many are seeking a new way to present which embodies and exemplifies the new times we are living into.\nWhat I am suggestion for the Post TED-like times is that we flip the focus and open a perspective which was barely available for us before. The perspectival pivot is from “why” to “how.” In employing Authenticity, Compassion, and Empathy as the ontological ground for communication, the process will effectively be opened towards emergence and connection. A presentation created and delivered using the “how” triumvirate will clear a path towards discovering new and perhaps unexpected outcomes. While not necessarily rigidly predictable, this approach will nonetheless lead towards something new and collectively experienced to emerge. What the speaker and audience authentically experience and produce together is something that will likely be remembered and acted upon; the ultimate end goals for any successful presentation.\nSo how do we proceed?\nWe proceed by employing our new triumvirate for the 21st century Post TED-like style presentations:\n  Authenticity. The bad news is that you will never become the mash-up of your favorite presenters; the good news, however, is that you can only be you. And by being fully and uniquely you, you are offering your audience something that no other speaker can. A gift which audience after audience comes in the hope of finding but so rarely do, as speaker after speaker disappoint us by using formulaic devices and never fully show up. No matter how skillfully acted and played on “stage,” be it an actual stage in a theater, across the space of a board room, or face to face with another person; without communicating from your authentic core, your audience will be sorely disappointed and will be left unsatisfied by the effort. Thus, audiences are very unlikely to either remember it, or act upon your message. Authenticity takes courage and trust, and with some support can very readily be developed.\n  Compassion. Compassion means that you earnestly seek to lessen the suffering of another. And this is way overdue as far too many audiences have been pummeled into somnambulistic submission by far too many win-seeking speakers using their “whys” as ramming rods for attention dominance. Of course, this never works out well for too long. Our new Post TED-like style calls for careful compassionate consideration of each and every one of our audiences, no matter how large or small the number. From individuals to stadiums, compassion must come first. Give your ego the day off and take the time to work out their needs first, not yours. Speak authentically to that and your will always be very warmly welcomed and likewise your message will be warmly received and retained.\n  Empathy. Whereas compassion refers to your desire to relieve suffering; empathy is the ability to feel for the other. As we say, to put yourself in the other’s shoes and both see and feel their worldview. Once you compassionately know their needs, then you feel through them and construct your communication in a respectful manner which corresponds to their intellectual and emotional requirements which they carry into this communicational context. For you as a speaker, it is more advantageous to be fully felt than to be loudly and coldly heard. Shouting your “why” regardless of the internal state of your audience, will only lead to mutual disappointment in the end.\n  Thus, we now have it.\nThe “how” for the Post TED-like style for 21st century presenting and communicating. By always being your authentic self, compassionately looking to help your audience, and empathetically delivering your message, you are clearing the way for highly meaningful and emergent communication to occur!\nJust in time for when we need it most.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/01/07/2020-01-07-life-after-ted-how-to-show-up-in-the-post-ted-world/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"Life after TED: How to show up in the Post-TED world"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"The lectern is a staple of traditional speeches.

Who, apart from politicians, still uses a lectern?\nIf I had to create a 0 to 10 presentation scale where 0 is totally informal and 10 is fully formal, I would say that running naked on stage is 0 and speaking from behind a lectern is 11. Yes, the lectern is really that formal, and in 99% of the cases, that\u0026rsquo;s not a good thing.\nOur advice is simple: if you\u0026rsquo;re not a politician, avoid the lectern. Even the CEOs of the biggest companies today do without it. And even for politicians, the lectern can be challenged, as Obama proved when he did some of his best speeches standing right in front of the crowd. Instead, ask for a microphone (preferrably a TED-style headset), get closer to the audience and start a conversation.\nThe only exception is when speaking in countries where respect of tradition is extremely important. If unsure, ask if you can move on stage. If you still have doubts then it is best to stay behind the lectern to avoid shocking the audience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/12/17/2019-12-17-should-i-stand-behind-the-lectern/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Should I stand behind the lectern?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Dave Paradi, an expert on PowerPoint presentations, has published the results of the annoying PowerPoint survey. We are not going to discuss the full results here, but what is clear is that the top 3 hasn’t changed much in many years. You could probably guess them just by asking yourself “what do I hate about PowerPoint presentations?” The top three problems are:\n  The speaker reads the slides to us\n  The text is too small\n  Use of full sentences\nNumber one is a no. This is one of the first things we teach to people using “slideuments”: never read your presentation. A presentation is not a prompter that you read at the same time as your audience. This is an extremely ineffective method of communication. It will bore your audience so much they will fall asleep or start crying.\nNumber two is obvious, or rather should be obvious: text that is so small nobody can read it is useless, and should be avoided.\nNumber three is a bit weird. Why would people be annoyed by full sentences? Using short and simple sentences is fine. We think that the correct formulation for that problem should be “use of sentences that are too long or too complicated.”\n  Text overload\n  Not having a clear purpose\n  Not having a clear flow of ideas.\n  All common problems that we still see in most companies. Number 4, text overload, is a sign that the presenter doesn’t know the difference between a slideument (a written document being used as a presentation in front of an audience) and an actual presentation (a slideshow showing only what reinforces or clarifies the message). Not having a clear purpose, point number 5, is usually a sign of poor preparation, and a sign of focusing on what is in the presenter’s mind instead of what should be communicated to the audience. Number 6, not having a clear flow of ideas, is directly connected to number 5 and is another symptom of the same root causes.\nWe have simple advice to avoid these 6 problems:\n Don’t read your slides. Instead, learn the storyline and talk naturally to your audience. Use a visual presentation, showing only what is needed to clarify or reinforce your message. Never use slideuments, written documents disguised as PowerPoint presentations, on screen in front of an audience. Make sure that all text is at least 16 pt or better 24 pt. Actual size may vary depending on the room setting. The bigger the room, the bigger the text needs to be. When creating your slides, take a step back from your computer screen and check that you can read everything from a distance. Use only a few words or very simple sentences. Sentences that are more than one or two lines long should usually be avoided. Use the Audience Transformation Roadmap to structure and prepare the content of your presentation.  You can read the full results of Dave Paradi’s survey here.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/12/10/2019-12-10-three-most-annoying-problems-presentations-powerpoint/","summary":"","tags":["PowerPoint","Slides","Design"],"title":"Three most annoying problems with business presentations, according to PowerPoint expert Dave Paradi"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"First, a mandatory disclaimer: I like Sixties-Boomer music. If poor musical tastes offend you, don’t read this.\nLast week, I was searching for an old song on YouTube, when suddenly I noticed a video from Joan Baez. I realized that, despite priding myself on my knowledge of 60s music, I never actually listened to one of her songs. So I clicked and listened to it. It was called Diamonds and Rust.\nThe first thing that struck me was that Joan Baez has a voice that is nearly too perfect, especially compared to Bob Dylan\u0026rsquo;s, her contemporary and, for a brief time, lover. The chord progression is fairly standard. The lyrics are OK, but not amazing. They tell a story of love and betrayal, an extremely common theme.\nWhat makes this song special is not the chords or the lyrics. It\u0026rsquo;s the story behind the story. This song doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell just a story of love and betrayal. It tells Joan\u0026rsquo;s own love and betrayal story with Bob Dylan. This is what gives this song so much resonance, so much meaning: the moment you realize that Joan is laying her wounds bare to the listener, the whole act takes another emotional dimension.\nThis emotional depth is what makes truly great stories. And to achieve it, you have to accept being fully vulnerable on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/12/03/2019-12-03-the-story-behind-the-story/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"The story behind the story"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Some leaders are afraid to let other people know that they took public speaking coaching. I want to explain why it’s a mistake, and why the best leaders are proud of being coached.\nThe Consulting Partner who hired me back in 1996, for a company that was then called Andersen Consulting, was an extremely charismatic person and an excellent orator. One advice he gave openly to his peers, and to us young consultants, was to get professional public speaking coaching to become better orators. He was proud to say that he took coaching sessions.\nI could witness the huge difference between his oratory skills and the skill of another partner during two “techno meetings” where all European technology consultants met for two days. The first year, the event took place in Disneyland Paris. The master of ceremony was the head of the French Technology practice, but he struggled to become alive on stage. He was so fixated on the idea that because he was a partner he didn’t need coaching (or rather, didn’t dare to tell others that he needed coaching) that he failed to show the necessary oratory skills to turn a multimillion event into a great success. His stress and awkwardness on stage were so obvious that it made everyone feel uneasy. All because he thought that as a partner he shouldn’t need coaching.\nThe next year, the Techno meeting took place in Brussels, and the partner who hired me was the master of ceremony. Despite being a good orator, or maybe, because he was a good orator, he didn’t come on stage unprepared. He took public speaking coaching sessions to make sure he would be 100% ready. What a difference it made. Everyone was captivated, laughed, listened and remembered the stage sessions as a highlight of the event. Despite being in a more modest place than Disneyland, the event was a great success (and the party music was better too!)\nThat partner was not perfect. He had his flaws, as we all have. But I will always remember that as a leader, being coached should be natural. All top leaders and politicians admit freely that coaching is very important. They are secure about themselves and see being coached as another way to improve their skills. And in the end, that approach makes them even better leaders.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/26/2019-11-26-being-coached-is-the-mark-of-true-leaders/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Coaching"],"title":"Being coached is the mark of true leaders"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"What happens when two parties position themselves in a similar manner on the same topic? Simple: the one which is the most credible wins. By “most credible,” I mean “the one that incarnates the rhetoric with the most authenticity.”\nThere is a mistake that has been made by many traditional parties. Some traditional parties saw new parties start to gain popularity by advocating extremist views. So they started to adopt a slightly watered down version of these views to attract voters. But they were terribly wrong. By doing so, they got doubly punished: they destroyed part of their credibility by betraying their historical values, and also managed to give a broader acceptance to these extremist views, making them more mainstream and putting extremist ideas in the spotlight. The exact opposite of what they intended to do.\nTraditional parties are never going to win the battle of extremism. People who are already convinced by these extremist views are going to vote for the extremist parties; and even more now in the social media age as their confirmation biases are continually affirmed. People who hesitate, the extremely important floating voters, are swayed towards extremist parties, because their views are made more acceptable by being embraced by the traditional parties.\nThere is only one way to win against extremism. It’s to fight it without compromise and never let it become acceptable. Yes, there are problems that must be solved. Yes, our world is imperfect. Yes, the way some people take advantage of the system is unacceptable. But we must never let racism, sexism or other movements based on the assumption that some humans are superiors to others become acceptable at any level of our societies. And we must speak out authentically against all extremism.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/19/2019-11-19-what-happens-when-two-political-parties-use-the-same-rhetoric/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"What happens when two political parties use the same rhetoric?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You’ve probably already seen those presenters who climb on stage and rush into their presentation, apparently oblivious to the fact that they have an audience in front of them.

I’ve just given the most, I mean most boring presentation of my life and I need to learn how to give a more interesting and captivating presentation.\nMichael: So what happened?\nRose: I just gave the most boring presentation of my life.\nMichael: How? What did people say?\nRose: Something about my voice. And they don’t care what I had to say.\nMichael: Sounds to me like it’s monotony, right?\nRose: Yeah that sounds about right.\nMichael: So they said you sounded monotonous. That is a problem with presenting for sure. But I do have a solution.\nRose: What’s that?\nMichael: It’s called the Four Tempos. Now, the four tempos are based on work by Yat Malmgrem who created movement psychology when he worked with dancers and actors. What I’ve done is I’ve taken it and made it more simple and useful for speakers. Get a pen and try it. Write it down.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: So, imagine an axis. First axis is the intention: light and strong. Second axis is vowels: short vowels, long vowels. Let’s hit the first tempo. The first tempo is called bright.\nRose: Bright.\nMichael: Bright is short vowels and light intention. Okay? So it’s like a dabbing rhythm: dab-dab-dab. And you link it with the objective of humoring the audience, welcoming them. You know, just kind of getting a light and friendly tone going when you speak. Give it a try.\nRose: Welcome, today I have great news.\nMichael: That’s great, you see. Excellent. Let’s move on to the second tempo. The second tempo is called human. That’s light intention and long vowels. So we link that with the objective of reassuring an audience, to calm them, to seduce them even. Give it a try.\nRose: Our technology is as relevant as ever.\nMichael: Excellent! So the third tempo is called bold. Bold is strong intention and short vowels. So the motivation here is to get their attention, wake them up, make them motivated with this punchy kind of rhythm. All right? Pam, pam, pam! Give it a try.\nRose: With three million new users we are ready to take new risks!\nMichael: That’s it! Excellent! Great. And now onto the last tempo, which is called captivating. Captivating is strong intention and long vowels. Right? So this is linked with objectives such as to underscore, to really spell something out or perhaps even to threaten your audience, or to warn them. Kind of like a pushing tempo. Give it a try.\nRose: Okay. So, let’s seize the future together.\nMichael: Yeah, together! Excellent, very good. So that’s it. Bright, human, bold, captivating. And you can mix up your vocal rhythms and tempos and wake the audience up and get them more interested in what you’re saying.\nRose: That’s fantastic. Thank you so much Michael. I’m really glad I came here. So let’s recap.\nKEY TAKE AWAYS\n Engage your listeners with different tempos. Make your messages more memorable with phrasing. Link your vocal rhythm to your objective.

Using a few of these clichés is fine, because they are often the clearest way to illustrate the idea of the slide; it’s nice to be creative, but clarity of the message comes first.\nBut some presentations seem to overflow with these clichés, using them on every slide. So I asked myself the question: why are some presentations nearly cliché-free, while other presentations are full of them? This question is not as trivial as it may seem. In fact, after some thinking and reviewing the presentations that used a lot of clichés, I realized why: it’s because their narrative is cliché. They are loaded with abstract business concepts such as engagement, empowerment, synergies, but are empty of concrete elements. These presentations promise a lot, but have nothing concrete to show for it.\nSo when a presentation requires the use of too many clichés, the right thing to ask ourselves is: how could I make the content more concrete? Instead of the cheesy handshake to illustrate collaboration, show a picture of your employees having fun during a team-building activity. Instead of the light bulb to represent innovation, show the latest ideas from your teams. Instead of the generic upward graph, show real results.\nIn a company where none of these concrete elements can be found, I would seriously ask myself why.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/05/2019-11-05-cliche-slides/","summary":"","tags":["Slides","PowerPoint","Visuals"],"title":"Cliché slides"},{"author":"Joe Ross","contents":"The days of the expert or reliable narrator are over. We have entered the “Disinformation Age” where fake news, conspiracy stories, and meme warfare rule.\nOne of the most prominent casualties, at least from a presentation perspective, is the TED-like style, top down, subject matter expert: the teacher or preacher schooling their passively sitting and listening students.\nWe see trust move from the command and control leadership style and morph into something vastly flatter, decentralized/distributed, and perhaps even autonomously self-organizing.\nIn our new “Disinformation Age,” information distribution has become democratized. Anyone with an internet access can create and upload written, audio, or visual content with a click of a button. The problem though is that not all content is equal. Anyone with a YouTube account and a smart phone can suddenly appear as a subject matter expert on just about any topic in ten minutes or less in lieu of the ten years on average of postgraduate work that real experts put in. I don’t know about you, but when I am sick, or my kids come down with something, I rely on our medical professionals who have logged the ten plus years of study combined with twenty plus years of practice, over a self-made expert with a microphone telling me that vaccines are part of a global plot to control citizens, or my 40-degree fever is just a physical manifestation of what’s in my head. I don’t want to draw a hard line here, as there may be some truth that mental stress plays a role in illness, but I believe you see my point.\nWe have now entered a time of post-experts and post-trusted informers. The days of the trusted TV news anchor broadcasting are long behind us; we find ourselves awash in a war of contradicting narratives vying for the support of the masses as justification of their validity.\nSo, are TED-style talks still the best way to communicate?\nCan this be one of the root reasons why audience taste has been declining for these “experts” tell all events? It is very difficult to have exact statistics, but clearly, and especially for the younger generation, the passion for hearing the word coming down from on high is waning. Just as in education, the trend towards a different approach of knowledge sharing is on the rise; however that is not my subject as we have all been enriched and enlightened by earnest TED and TEDx speakers over the years.\nHowever, we must ask now, what is coming after, what was learned and what needs to transform?\nFirst, why we are growing tired of the TED-like style; what is advancing us towards the end of our decade old love affair? Let me suggest some things that I identified in concert with my colleague at Ideas on Stage, Michael Rickwood, of which we have grown weary.\nThere is the old saying, familiarity breeds contempt, perhaps this applies here. There are just too many TED-like events happening just about every week in every city; too much of something, no matter how good, becomes tiring. We are becoming to see the fatigue of familiarity creep in.\nAnd why do we feel familiarity? I mean if every talk has a different topic, why should we become familiar? I’d suggest that it is not the topic’s fault; rather it is the now formulaic and repetitive manner by which speakers prepare and deliver their talks. They seem to be more focused on presenting like all the presenters they have watched before, and never really stop a moment to consider their audience and what those buying tickets might be expecting.\nWhat do I mean by formulaic? Well, I’d suspect that if you watched a fair number of presentations, you could probably tell me! In fact, there are sadly funny talks where presenters mock the now traditional TED-like style of presenting, i.e. the surprise twists, the moment of the now predictable sudden twist in the plot, and above all the “happy ending” emotion-laden finish carefully crafted to gain applause.\nAnd of course, there are the occasional opportunists who use these events to hijack the stage for self-promoting purposes.\nThis style of presenting—please see an earlier article that Michael and I posted on Pathos, Ethos, Logos—contributes to an imbalance towards pathos is our general presentation style. Now we have both business leaders and politicians playing to the emotions with often little regard for either the veracity, i.e. truth, facts of the situation; and worse, with little regard for the ethos, the ethical moral side of the case.\nNo wonder we are in the state we are.\nWe have lost the balance in the storytelling formula. As Ideas on Stage cofounder Pierre Morsa puts it, “The formula is like for Hollywood movies. It is necessary: movies that miss one ingredient of the formula are often failures. You can omit some elements, but you have to understand the impact of doing so. And ultimately, although all Hollywood movies use the same formula, some are great and some suck.”\nSo, what do we do?\nWe, at Ideas on Stage are coaching our speakers towards what we have come to call, the “Post-Ted” style of presenting.\nWe will explore and define this in a forthcoming article, but not to leave you hanging; as the classic TED-like style talk might use to build up suspense and keep you listening … well, maybe I am here, but that is too meta for this article.\nWhat we are leading is the “Post-Ted” presentation approach, one that fronts an ethical and balanced presentation by employing honest communication that has these three pillars: authenticity, compassion, and empathy.\nThese may very well be the new triumvirate for the 21st century and quite possibly could rekindle our passion for presentation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/10/29/2019-10-29-wash-that-ted-right-out-of-your-head-avoiding-bad-ted-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Wash that Ted right out of your head: new post-Ted presentation"},{"author":"Camille Spokojny","contents":"A funny thing happened when I was describing my “dream job” to a friend. I imagined a company whose mission would be to help people become great presenters, and had a culture that was both supporting and nurturing while remaining professional and attentive to clients’ needs. My friend said: “I know that company!”\nA few weeks later after a relaxing summer vacation between positions, I found myself in the company of all my new colleagues, some whom I met for the very first time, at our annual Fall team meeting.

And that means we can help more speakers to shine on stage, more leaders to inspire their people, and more event organizers to design and produce the kind of business events we’d all love to attend.\nIs this my “dream job?” It certainly sounds like it.

They can be your employees, your clients, your products, your revenue. They can even be your competitors. Now, what about the setting?\nRose: That\u0026rsquo;s your business context. How are the numbers doing? What\u0026rsquo;s happening in your industry?

We were losing money. So we created a new product which allowed us to raise sales by 10 percent and we hit our goal of 1 billion in revenue.\nPierre: Great story.\nRose: So now we know how to apply these five ingredients to business. Pierre, can we apply everything in traditional storytelling to business story?\nPierre: There is one key difference. In business storytelling you can tell anecdotes, you can tell metaphors, but the key messages should always be based on facts. This is something which is very important and that we will cover in another episode.\nRose: Excellent. So let\u0026rsquo;s recap.\nKey Take Aways  Use all five ingredients to tell a business story. The ingredients are: subject, context, need or problem, solution, and conclusion. Business stories are always based on fact.  Pierre: Thank you. There is a lot more to learn about storytelling.

Moving around aimlessly is not. It’s what we call derivative actions, things that we do unconsciously that betray our stress, lack of confidence or lack of preparation.

Making eye contact with your audience will stabilise your attention and will prevent your feet from moving you around the stage.\nThe trick is to always look at someone in the eye when you talk, alternating between people in various locations in the audience. Make sure you take the time to deliver at least one full sentence before shifting your gaze to someone else. And really look at the person, not just in their general direction.

Suddenly I think of cookie dough, the small crunchy granules of sugar blended with butter, the heavenly flavour of vanilla extract and the sublime melt of dark chocolate chips. Even before I bake the cookies, the main event in this case, the ingredients themselves have satisfied.\nDesigning events are similar because I love what goes into making them delicious–I mean, shine. To create an event that is truly memorable, impactful and enjoyable you need a blend of four key ingredients: 1. Purpose 2. Teamwork 3. Creativity 4. Action\nSurely great music, a uniting theme, an excellent MC, or an inspirational speaker can make a difference, but with these four basic ingredients we believe you can make magic out of any topic whether it be a medical conference or TEDx event.\nAs the title states, an amazing event is an active one. The event’s purpose is what points to the type of meaningful action you might incorporate. Here are 12 specific ideas for how you can incorporate our 3 main messages in this corresponding video podcast episode on Amazing Events.\nSurely great music, a uniting theme, an excellent MC, or an inspirational speaker can make a difference, but with just these four ingredients we believe you can make magic out of any topic whether it be a medical conference or TEDx event.\nAs the title states, an amazing event is an active one. The event’s purpose is what points to the type of meaningful action you might incorporate. Here are a 12 specific ideas for how you can incorporate the 3 overarching takeaways in our corresponding video podcast episode on Amazing Events.\nTip 1: Only use presentations when necessary Of course there are times when a classic keynote is just the ticket to open or close a conference. Just bear in mind that presentations are not the best way for your team to learn information. Here are a few ways you can inspire and engage your audience both with and beyond presentations:\n1 - Be Lean: when you speak be sure to reset audience attention every 10 minutes, according to mind expert John Medina, author of Brain Rules. You can do this in many ways such as by asking a question or sharing a relevant emotionally compelling anecdote. The less we tell people, the more they remember. So keep your presentation compelling and clear with 1-3 key messages tops.\n2 - Panels: gather a few key opinion leaders whether internal or external, aim for diversity, and add a skilled moderator to create a dynamic and energized discussion.\n3 - Q\u0026amp;A: give your audience a chance to ask their burning questions and aim to be honest, clear and direct in your responses. This can be especially helpful around the rollout of a new program or initiative, or to rebuild trust around a project or leader.\n4 - Group activities: give your team a chance to work in smaller groups to discuss a key question or topic with enough instruction that they are clear how to spend their time and what their objective is and enough freedom to really explore and come to new insight. Then have a spokesperson share a quick update with the larger group.\nTip 2: Do Something! This doesn’t mean people should never sit down during an event or be artifically sporty, nor should you resort to: ‘let’s just throw in an escape game and call it a day’. What we are suggesting is to tap the deeper potential of your team by calling in their whole selves during your event. We are human beings, not laptops. We are meant to move and our brains impressively better when we do. Research shows that activity, creativity and collaboration improve learning and memory retention. Here are few ideas to get the ball rolling on how to pack some action in your event:\n5 - Workshops: when participants get their hands dirty trying to solve a problem related to the purpose of your event, even briefly, they wake up and new neurons fire. Participants become engaged and invested in finding a way forward and more open to solutions.\n6 - Pitch it: instead of long-winded presentations, try a timed 5-10minute pitch and even more fun if you have a few which can playfully compete on fun criteria like most imaginative.\n7 - Stand-up brainstorms: before hearing a presentation why not ask your team to break out into small groups around a paper board, set a timer and brainstorm on a question or issue related to the event topic. After that they’ll be many times more receptive to hearing what you wanted to share with them because they had the opportunity to reflect first about the need.\n8 - Play: have participants improvise a skit, record a video, or write a song in alignment with the purpose of the event. Thinking in new ways and sharing it unleashes new synergy and trust in teams.\nTip 3: Make it memorable with the unexpected We have seen traditional companies host IT conferences and Pharmaceutical teams present new research in refreshing ways. This makes all the difference. If you know everyone loves the champagne hour then keep that in and iterate on the type of speaker or the flow of the event. Here are a few ways you might spice things up…\n9 - Theme: Giving your event a theme is a great way to unite many messages and new information under a meaningful umbrella. We worked on an event called SHIFT, which as you may have guessed was all about “shifting” culture to be more efficient, connected, customer focused and fun. They used activities like test-driving a Tesla and having a formula 1 race simulator available during the breaks. (You can read about the event here.)\n10 - Team building: we also worked on a memorable event that included a team-building treasure hunt in small groups all around Athens, where the conference was held. Meaningful connections occur in moments least expected, like while taking shelter from a downpour in a quaint café over hot Greek coffee.\n11 - Simple delights: have you ever left a welcome note or a little gift related to the event on your guests hotel bed for them to discover upon arrival? Or invited teams to wear their favorite t-shirt? Or all orange? How about hosting a single-song dance party in the middle of a conference? Possible outcome: a little sweat, a burst of laughter and lots of new energy.\n12 - Don’t skip the breaks: we suggest the Disney rule which respects that fact that nature calls us all usually around 1 hour 20 minutes especially after all the coffee we tend to drink to stay alert during long stretches of focus. Then take a longer break at least every 3 hours for a meal or nourishing refreshments. Tip: keep meals and snacks healthy to keep energy and attention high.\nIn sum, events can be wonderful, meaningful and valuable, especially when they’re active. A well planned gathering can pump new energy, motivation and commitment into an organisation. This energy is what we need to turn around a dwindling initiative, improve employee retention and inspire internal innovation. This happens when teams are offered an event developed with purpose and their experience in mind.\nSo remember the four key ingredients to make your next event amazing: purpose, teamwork, creativity and action. We hope this has inspired you even a little with how to turn up the volume on engagement and impact for your next event.\nIf you’d like to discuss how we can help boost activate these inherent elements and make something unforgettable feel free to reach out directly at info@ideasonstage.com.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/24/2019-09-24-to-make-an-amazing-event-don-t-just-sit-there-do-something/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Events","Tips"],"title":"12 Tips for an Amazing Event: Don’t Just Sit There, DO Something"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Some adults behave like bad, spoiled kids. They whine, they threaten, they become petty if they don’t get their way. They don’t hesitate to lie, or even worse, use the emotional card to play the victim, make you look bad and make you submit to their will.\nThese people are easy to recognize, but very difficult to deal with. Just think of the child rolling on the floor screaming. His parents will look bad whatever they do: scold him, do nothing, leave… they have zero good solutions. Other parents know this and usually try to look the other way. And those other parents who intervene usually only make matters worse, because they’re actually looking to shame the child’s parents, which solves nothing and reinforces the child’s power.\nIn front of a spoiled kid rolling on the floor, there seems to be no solution that would not make you look like you’re the bad one. It’s the same for spoiled adults. They derive their power from the fact that whatever you do to try to stop them, you’ll be the one who looks bad.\nSo, what do you do when you’re facing a spoiled adult in a debate or during a Q\u0026amp;A session? You keep calm and dispassionate. If you let your emotions get the better of you, you play by the spoiled adult’s rules and start a contest you cannot win. Instead, refuse to enter into a shouting contest, and re-center the debate or question around the core message, the central pillar. Soon you will be perceived as the responsible adult in charge. The spoiled adult will become a screaming fool.\nWhen possible, there’s an even better solution: take care of the problem before the debate, or at least instill doubt in the mind of the spoiled adult. Show him or her you’re not going to play by their rules. Or let them believe their over-the-top attitude is working, then take them off guard by being the responsible adult on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/17/2019-09-17-the-adult-and-the-spoilt-kid/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"The adult and the spoiled kid"},{"author":"","contents":"  Rose: Most people think that a great event is one that fits everything into the agenda. The more the better. Well, we want to share that less is more, especially when it comes to presentations. Today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have three tips for you on how to create an amazing business event by making it active.\nTip 1: Only use presentations when necessary. Michael: Hey Rose, what are you reading there?\nRose: Presentation Zen.\nMichael: Ah, Presentation Zen!\nMichael: Actually \u0026hellip;. [sped-up long talk about the book]\nRose: So, if you want your employees to remember the information in your event, reconsider all the presentations. The best thing you can give them is a cup of coffee, a book, and silence.\nTip 2: Make an active agenda for an amazing event. Rose: How many times have you been to a conference where you have sat in the same chair listening to what feels like the same presentation, doing nothing, in the same spot for hours and days? It\u0026rsquo;s like sitting on a swing set and not moving. Why? Because we have so much unused potential!\nRose: If you can, get your employees moving, and then you\u0026rsquo;ll see what\u0026rsquo;s really possible. Even better if they can do it together. So, think about workshops, and stand-up work sessions, and what happens if they go outside? You might just start having some fun!\nTip 3: Add in moments of delight, surprise, and breaks. Rose: Beware the impulse to overstuff the agenda for your event. In fact, you need to work in little moments of delight, surprise, and especially breaks. This is the gold in your agenda. This is the time when people start to network and come up with new ideas, and absorb what they\u0026rsquo;ve just learned in the event. So, Michael, what did you think of that last presentation?\nMichael: You know what? I thought it was pretty good.\nKEY TAKE AWAYS  Only use presentations when necessary.

Persuading the human mind.\nToday there is a war on for attention and space, with the human mind as object of the conquest. In 2019, emotions rule the stage and calm reasoned logic seems to have gone out of fashion. Individually and collectively, most of us are getting our information from sound bites, news summaries, and short burst headlines provided by our iPhone feed; while opinions change from one glance at the screen to the next.\nIn this modern landscape, effective presentations and the art of the pitch are more important than ever. To stand out from the noise, in brief 3 minutes or less bursts, is the day’s challenge. Effective, memorable and entertaining have become the new keywords; and the active effort to do this well means positively that we are getting better at communication with each other in business and other arenas. By improving communication skills; things are getting shorter, clearer, more creative and somehow easier to contextualize. Quite a contrast to the once overly long and boring team meetings which have gotten a drastic time-cut in our offices for one!\nOn the flip side, however, the art of the pitch brings some negatives with it. We drown in messages delivered online through hyper-looped highways directly into the windows of our souls, and worse, every presentation ever given now goes on to YouTube and spreads through social media like an unwelcome summer cold.\nIn 2019, we are presented with a new paradigm. As things get flashier and nosier and we continue to focus on the how—continuing to make presentations shorter and zippier and catchier—are we forgetting about the what? And more importantly the why?\nMy experience of coaching TED talks has often led me to mixed feelings about these events. On the one hand, they are a great educational resource and inspirational platform for new leaders to get visibility. On the other they risk being an empty window of self-promotion.\nTo get to the heart of meaningful content, the why, we can look back to the Greeks.\nAnd the motivational compass that asks: What kind of a world do I want to live in anyway?\nIn ancient Greece, the principle of the persuasive argument by Aristotle was based on 3 key pillars: Ethos, Logos, and Pathos. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the focus in many industries swung to logos: with fact-based and structure being the focused pillar to build upon. Top down, left brain, siloed and reductionist in approach led to a scientific lab like communication style based upon informative data that could be reproduced easily and widely by using primitive means. Today, in the 21st century, with all our high-tech tools, always on multimedia screens, the shift is undeniably towards pathos: the emotional and creative pillar. This has been very welcome but sometimes communication that is too focused only on pathos leaves us with pretty and passionate presentations yet empty and directionless messaging. Ethos has remained present throughout all eras, particularly in the most inspiring of speeches. Leadership, vision and shared experience lighting the way for future generations.\nA balance of all 3 was the original blueprint some three thousand years ago. But it appears Ethos is under threat in certain political spheres, and this can only trickle down to the wider world of business and education.\nIn 2019 we are on a wire. People are polarized, leaders are struggling. Villains in certain places prevail with pathos taking easy, below the belt shots, selling something that they cannot deliver. The compass is spinning, confused. People are not always constant or rooted like trees, many can shift like tectonic plates with many men and women as elastic as a waistline, gorging on a rubbish pathos laden diet. Sure, it might make you feel good for an instant, but the digestion is horribly unpleasant and ultimately harmful to the health of society writ large.\nHowever, history has shown us that working from an ethical center creates success, unites people and with united people comes stability and prosperity within the very largest groups or the smallest.\nWe have lost our balance. By swinging from overly logos centered communication to overly pathos centered communication; our Ethos, our WHY of being is endangered.\nWe recall a quote dating the French Revolution: “With great power, comes great responsibility” the adage is never truer than today. Whether you’re the leader of a small team in a firm or presiding over a giant corporation, what you say will influence the day, week, month and eventually even the lives of the people that you are addressing.\nEthics are about staying true to message, about meaning, and about vision; it’s about the why. From this ground you can build effective and persuasive communication that is solidly grounded while employing the other arts of Logos and Pathos.\nAs every great leader knows, it’s all about balance.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/09/2019-09-09-the-leadership-triangle/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Leadership","Business"],"title":"The leadership Triangle"},{"author":"Nayab Mohammad","contents":"Recently I had the chance to do an internship with Ideas on Stage, which has been by far one of my best experiences.\nAt first, I didn’t quite know what I had stepped into. It was a totally new place and I walked in full of curiosity.\nYou might know the famous saying “Behind every successful man there is a woman.” Well, within this week I understood that “behind every successful presentation there is Ideas on Stage.” They possess the secret key to turn anyone into an excellent speaker. They don’t work miracles, but they have enough magic to turn awful presentations into brilliant ones.\nFurthermore, I met a team with original personalities. A bunch of creative, cool and awesome people willing to take boredom out of this world. They are like a big family working in an enjoyable atmosphere, and I loved that.\nI always carry a quote in my bag that says “You learn something new every day,” which fits perfectly with the description of this week. Let me tell you more about it.\nMarine Bénard welcomed me on Monday morning, presented the company and kindly accompanied me throughout the week. Also, she handed me The Business Presentation Revolution, which, to make it short, taught me that if you want to SCORE in life you must learn your ABCs. (What does that mean? You’ll need to read the book or follow the course!)\nThe next day was a big dose of inspiration, motivation, and admiration. When I spoke with Phil Waknell, one of the founders of the company, I learned not only about Ideas on Stage’s values, but I also got tips on how to make a business work and what leadership is about. Phil enlightened me when he affirmed “Leadership is the art of being followed.”\nSpeaking of art, my favorite pieces of art are humans. And I believe speaking is a fundamental need for human beings. According to René Descartes, the French philosopher, the use of language as a manifestation of thought and ideas, makes the distinction between humans and animals. Therefore, working on communication is fundamental.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, I asked Vanessa Querville why she likes her job and she told me that it’s all about the impact. When she feels her coaching is moving something forward, helping the other person progress, that is when she gets a real sense of achievement. She faces a challenge to bring out the best speaker we can be.\nWith Frédéric-Pascal Stein, on Thursday afternoon, I understood that the magic of Ideas on Stage is to make us realize what someone in their right mind would do when it comes to presentations and pitches: be clear and simple. Get straight to the point. Do not annoy anybody, including yourself, with pointless details. Be confident and be yourself. A lot of what Ideas on Stage does is to show us obvious things we don’t manage to notice by ourselves.\nOn Friday, I got the opportunity to attend a coaching session with Michael Rickwood and I saw the way he adapted himself according to what his client needed. If the person needed to be reassured or if they only needed advice with some encouragement, Michael did what was most appropriate and did not try to impose a method his client was not looking for.\nOnly a small number of experiences change your perspectives, and this is one of them. I came out of this internship changed, transformed. These people caught 100% of my attention and my brain was fully concentrated and focused the entire time. Sharing their world for some time, and feeling as if I was a part of it, was wonderful.\nPeople often misuse the word outstanding, but Ideas on Stage can be qualified as outstanding because they do things differently. They are different and that is why they stand out from the rest. They deserve great things and something I will never forget from my internship is what Phil told me, it goes something like “be kind and life will be kind to you.”\nNayab Mohammad\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/02/2019-09-02-a-student-s-view-of-ideas-on-stage/","summary":"","tags":["News"],"title":"A student’s view of Ideas on Stage"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You may have heard about it, a basic security problem was found in Zoom for Mac, that allowed attackers to turn the camera on remotely. Zoom is an application used to organize videoconferences on the web. It works well and has been widely adopted by corporations and individuals seeking to provide a quality service to employees working remotely or on different sites.\nThe security problem itself was easy to correct, and, at the time of this article, should have been fixed. But there is something else Zoom needs to fix: its crisis communication approach. One thing in particular made users and the security community extremely unhappy: the “others do it too” attitude. It’s exactly when you reprimand your child because he did something wrong, and he answers, “but other kids did it too!” As a parent, it’s only going to make you even more annoyed. Why? Because that shows he doesn’t get the point, and that instead of learning from his mistake, he’s trying to get approval for his incorrect behavior. And this is basically what Zoom’s initial answer was: “We don’t need to fix this problem, and it’s not really a problem because others do it too.”\nThis is what we call the “others too” communication mistake. Using others’ bad behavior to justify yours. Pointing others’ mistakes is fine if you clearly show that you’re going to correct yours. Zoom’s impact would have been completely different if they had said, “We’re going to fix this problem immediately, others have that problem too.” By taking responsibility to correct their mistake first, the rest of the communication takes a whole different meaning. Small difference in wording, huge difference in result.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/16/2019-07-16-others-too-zoom-s-terrible-communication-misstep/","summary":"","tags":["Public Relations","Communication","Crisis Management","Business"],"title":"“Others Too”: Zoom's Terrible Communication Misstep"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"One of the most stressful moments when speaking at an event is actually not during your presentation, but the hours before your presentation. To some speakers, the wait can be so stressful that they completely lose their presence. As mother nature didn\u0026rsquo;t give humans an appropriate instinctive response to face the stress of a presentation, they adopt one of the basic survival techniques for protection: they fight the public, they flee, or they \u0026ldquo;play dead\u0026rdquo;. The longer they wait, the worse the problem becomes.\nMy advice is simple: put these speakers early in the program. You may want to put a seasoned speaker on stage first, but then I recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t let the nervous ones wait for too long. This will greatly reduce the risk of meltdown on stage.\nOf course, there are techniques to cope with stress. There are easy tricks, but when the source of the stress is a lack of self-confidence or self-esteem, that takes time to correct. In some cases, it can be a lifelong battle. If you feel some speakers are not going to manage the stress well, don\u0026rsquo;t make them wait for too long, it will make them feel miserable and they will not enjoy the experience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/09/2019-07-09-put-your-most-nervous-speakers-early-in-the-program/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Fear","Events"],"title":"Put your most nervous speakers early in the program"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You know these presenters who speak for 20 minutes before they finally understand what they are talking about? I had a colleague who was just like that. When I asked him why he couldn’t do a shorter introduction, he said that he felt that all the details he gave in his opening were indispensable to understand the presentation. In other words, he was taking the time to explain the context before talking about his subject. That sounded good in theory. The problem was, because nobody knew what the exact subject was, the elements of context had no meaning and were extremely boring. Making matters worse, because my colleague had not started by identifying the subject, he rambled for much longer than what was really necessary.\nHowever, correcting that problem is fairly easy.\nStart by presenting the “why you are talking today,” the key topics, before anything else. If these topics cannot be understood without context, then they are not clear enough, and should be reformulated.\nOnly once you have done that can you present the context. Avoid the “all you can eat” approach, only give the minimum necessary to understand the key topics.\nThis simple method will make your presentations much more interesting from the beginning, and much easier to follow for your audience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/02/2019-07-02-why-you-should-avoid-long-winded-introductions-in-your-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"Start with the subject, not the context"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Should we move on stage when speaking, to avoid looking static? Or should we stay put on our feet, avoiding any unnecessary movements? Strangely, if we ask different coaches, we\u0026rsquo;re likely to get different answers. I remember meeting several coaches who followed classical theatre training at \u0026ldquo;La Comédie Française\u0026rdquo;, and they would recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t move on stage when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking. I also remember other coaches telling startup pitchers that they looked like dead trees devoid of any energy because they didn\u0026rsquo;t move enough. So who is right?\nAs often, the correct answer is: it depends. It always pains me to see some coaches give \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; advice without taking into account the subtleties of public speaking. A few examples of factors that may influence how much you move:\n The formality of the setting Your natural style as a speaker The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be filmed  If we are in a very formal setting, typically a political meeting, it\u0026rsquo;s best no to move too much. If the setting is more informal, like a pitch contest, looking dynamic and energetic is essential, we can move on stage. We could even jump and everybody would be fine with it (although we recommend not to do it Ballmer style).\n  We saw some speakers deliver killer speeches sitting down or from behind a lectern, not moving at all. At the opposite end, we saw speakers pace energetically on stage and make a great impression. The key is that their posture was coherent with their style, and that when they moved, it was on purpose, not because they could not control their nerves. A good coach will help you understand and build a style that fits your personality, not force you into a predefined stereotypical imaginary \u0026ldquo;ideal presenter\u0026rdquo; (a notion I will develop further in another article).\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re being filmed, avoid moving around too much. It will make good camera work harder. Often the lighting is set to be optimal in a specific location of the stage. Try to stay there.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/06/25/2019-06-25-should-i-move-on-stage-when-speaking/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Oratory","Body Language"],"title":"Should I move on stage when speaking?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"The communication industry is full of myths that are repeated without any scientific backing.

Just like in many countries, good manners—the etiquette—dictate that we should not put our elbows on the table when we eat, we should not cross our arms when we present, not because it\u0026rsquo;s an actual blocking gesture, but because it\u0026rsquo;s considered inappropriate.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/06/18/2019-06-18-the-body-language-myth-of-crossing-your-arms/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Body language","Presenting"],"title":"The body language myth of crossing your arms"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Ideas on Stage now welcomes you in their Champs Élysées offices.

When we created the company, we rented a space in a shared office. But the business center was nearly always full and we had to book the rooms weeks in advance, which was extremely inconvenient. As a young company, we didn’t want to spend too much, so when the first promotion of startups graduated from the Parisian accelerator “Le Camping,” we moved with them in a place called “L’After,” a name that was more reminiscent of a place where spent partygoers would try to recover than a place where you conducted serious business. It was also a bit decrepit, and we had to fight for space between the ping-pong table and the Geeks.\nThis is history. Now we can welcome you in our offices on the Champs Élysées, the most prestigious avenue of Paris, the city of light.

One of these technologies is virtual reality. If you’re in the Paris area, we now have the possibility to supplement our traditional public speaking coaching with virtual reality in combination with our traditional oratory coaching.\nThere are many advantages to using virtual reality.

We always try to make speakers practice in a setting which is as close to the real situation as possible, but assembling 500 people in a room to play the public is simply not feasible. Virtual Reality changes that. It allows the speaker to face a virtual public and learn how to interact with it. The simulation of the emotions of the public will let the orator learn how to stay cool and manage any situation, and how to handle tough questions with confidence.\nThe public speaking virtual reality training simulation can be used in different situations, for example\n Presentation training for your sales team Negotiation training for managers Public speaking training for an internal event  In the comfort and discretion of our offices on the Champs Élysées, in the heart of Paris, you will get the most complete public speaking coaching possible.

I helped prepare it with my colleagues so I know the slides but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. Do you have any advice for me?\nMichael: Rose. What you need are the three S’s of Success.\nRose: What are those?\nMichael: First things first. Serenity. You\u0026rsquo;re going to stop working. You\u0026rsquo;ve been working very, very hard. Trust the fact that you know it, you know your slides. They\u0026rsquo;re finished. Put down the computer.\nRose: Put down\u0026hellip; put down the computer.\nMichael: Yep. I\u0026rsquo;m telling you to do that.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: Also to be serene, you cannot present effectively drinking coffee. This is really, really bad: coffee, energy drinks\u0026hellip; Put that aside.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: And put your phone on silent.\nRose: You\u0026rsquo;re going a little far, Michael.\nMichael: Put it on silent. Give your brain space to relax. And also, for serenity it’s important with regards to this venue, right?\nRose: Yeah.\nMichael: Get there early.\nRose: Ok. That\u0026rsquo;s okay. I can do that. I can get there early.\nMichael: Now the second S of Success is about Space. When you arrive at that venue tonight, early, make sure you give yourself time to go on stage. Stand up there. If you can, pass your slides, test your videos and have a go at rehearsing on stage. If you can\u0026rsquo;t with a technical team then rehearse by yourself looking at the room in front of you and discovering it.\nRose: That makes sense. OK. I\u0026rsquo;m going to get there early. I can test the stage. I can look at the space.\nMichael: Absolutely, and also know where you\u0026rsquo;re entering from, where you\u0026rsquo;re exiting and where you\u0026rsquo;re going to be placed before you show up on stage, and also know where the water is. In case you get dry mouth or something like that.\nRose: OK. That actually really helps, just to start imagining the space. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it quickly but I think I will go back and I\u0026rsquo;ll check the stage and do exactly like you said: entrances, exits\u0026hellip;\nMichael: Exactly.\nRose: …where am I sitting before I present. I feel pretty good with those two first S\u0026rsquo;s: Serenity, Space. What\u0026rsquo;s the third S?\nMichael: So the third S is basically to seek Support. So, when you get there, seek out who are the technical people lighting you, miking you up, and looking after the slides and the guy who has the clicker. Because these people are great to introduce yourself to, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking after you and you\u0026rsquo;re going to feel so much better about doing that.\nRose: Michael, this is making so much sense. It has really helped me calm down and I know our viewers can relate to that moment. So, would you recap these three excellent S\u0026rsquo;s for us?\nMichael: Absolutely. First one: Serenity - find your focus and find your calm. Two: Space - get into the space where you\u0026rsquo;re gonna be presenting. Three: Seek out technical Support. Get to know the guys who are looking after you and making you great on stage.\n Serenity: find your focus and your calm. Space: get into the space where you’re going to present. Support: seek out technical help.  Rose: So if you enjoyed what you heard here today, please join the revolution by subscribing to our YouTube channel, iTunes and following us on LinkedIn. We hope to see you next time. Please leave your comments, like, share with your colleagues. And may you stay serene for your next presentation. Thanks again Michael.

With its dramatic zooming and panning effects, it certainly did catch the eye of audiences worldwide when it was introduced. But its over-reliance on movement effects quickly became a visual nuisance, making the audience feel as if they had been on a boat caught in a category 10 hurricane. During the first three years after its launch we got requests for Prezi presentations regularly, but it’s not the case anymore. So what went wrong with Prezi? The core problem of Prezi is simple: it does not address the real problem of PowerPoint. Audiences are not bored because of PowerPoint, but because of how PowerPoint is misused by presenters, and adding more zooming in and out ad nauseam is not going to solve anything. The true remedy to bad PowerPoint presentations lies somewhere else:\n Teaching speakers how to build a compelling narrative for their presentations before opening PowerPoint. Designing slides that effectively reinforce or clarify the speaker’s story.  Don’t be mistaken. With the right skills, it is possible to use Prezi to create a great visual story, but for most use cases PowerPoint will be as good or better.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/28/2019-05-28-why-prezi-failed-at-revolutionizing-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["PowerPoint","Prezi","TEDx","Presentation","Slides"],"title":"Why Prezi failed at revolutionizing presentations"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"By now, the last episode of the cult show Game of Thrones has aired. I haven’t seen it, and I didn’t want to see it before writing this article. Whether it accurately follows the storyline of the books or not is a moot point, because said book hasn’t been written yet. And it shows. I won’t spoil anything, don’t worry. But everyone noticed that the screenwriting of the seasons that could rely on George R. R. Martin’s material was much better than the seasons that had to rely on external writers. And I will use that as an example of how important a great storyline is for a great presentation.\nLet’s first look at the material that the showrunners used for the first seasons of Game of Thrones, the books collectively known as “A Song of Ice and Fire,” written by George R. R. Martin (aka GRRM). I’m not a fan of GRRM’s writing style. I find the general style of the sentences a bit “plain.” However, GRRM is exceptional at two things:\n The storyline. The perfect plot and its twists were what made Game of Thrones what it is. By refusing to follow common writing wisdom in favor of a more complex, realistic and gritty storyline, GRRM created numerous shocks and surprises, but none of them were gratuitous. They were all at the service of the storyline. Short killer lines that could accomplish in a few words what could not have been done in several pages of writing. Take Tyrion, for example. The fact that he is one of the most beloved characters in the series is entirely due to the great lines GRRM put in his mouth.  If you compare it to the seasons filmed without GRRM’s books, it’s plain that:\n The storyline is much more conventional. There are a lot more deus ex machina moments. Some plot twists feel forced and illogical. It’s clear the writers wanted to capture the spirit of GRRM’s writing, but didn’t manage to put their plot twists at the service of the storyline. The short killer lines are gone. Not much more to say. This is why Tyrion feels so useless during these last seasons.  What does it mean for your presentations? It means that the storyline always comes first. Everything you say and show has to be directly relevant to the storyline. The storyline will dictate how easy (or how hard) your presentation is to follow. The storyline will dictate how surprising, how impactful your presentation will be.\nThe storyline is not everything, as the short killer lines demonstrate. A presentation is much more: the quality of the delivery, the quality of the visuals, etc. But the storyline is its backbone, and cannot be rushed.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/21/2019-05-21-game-of-thrones-and-the-importance-of-the-storyline/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storyline","Storytelling","Presentations"],"title":"Game of Thrones and the importance of the storyline"},{"author":"","contents":"  Transcript Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution! I\u0026rsquo;m here with my colleague Michael Rickwood who\u0026rsquo;s going to be sharing with us what to do with our bodies while presenting.\nSo Michael, our clients regularly ask us: “What do I do with my body, my hands, my face while presenting?” What do you tell your clients?\nRose, what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about is gestures and we all need to use them on stage, but to be better at gestures it\u0026rsquo;s good to know about the four different types of gestures that we can use to be more effective communicators on stage.\nThere are four types of gestures?\nOK, what\u0026rsquo;s the first one? The first ones are called illustrators. Now these are the gestures that you use while you\u0026rsquo;re speaking and these are great for three reasons. The first reason is that it helps people to absorb better what you’re saying. The next reason is because it helps you to channel stress. And the third reason is it helps you to remember your words as you\u0026rsquo;re speaking.\nOkay, so there are some that we\u0026rsquo;re using while we\u0026rsquo;re talking like the Italians do. What\u0026rsquo;s the second type of gesture?\nThe second type of gestures - on a cultural note - are called emblems. These are the gestures that you\u0026rsquo;re using when you don\u0026rsquo;t speak or don\u0026rsquo;t have any words, so gestures that really speak for themselves. So for example Rose you\u0026rsquo;re from the USA. In the USA you have specific nonverbal gestures like that which will work right, like thumbs up or hello goodbye.\nNot every gesture works in every country so that\u0026rsquo;s something to think about. That\u0026rsquo;s really important if you\u0026rsquo;re doing international business. One thing might mean something very positive in one country such as our OK sign in America, and that could mean something very different in another country. So with intercultural communication it\u0026rsquo;s important to have a little coaching on that beforehand.\nAll right, what\u0026rsquo;s our next gesture Michael?\nSo now I want to talk about the face and what we call affect displays. Now the face is very expressive and this is very useful for example with storytelling: we want to tell about a past experience. The face is very important. How can we make the most of it?\nOK, I love that and something that it makes me think of is congruence and how important it is that our facial expressions agree with what we\u0026rsquo;re doing with our body. So if you\u0026rsquo;re telling a positive message, having that effect of a positive expression - a smile etc - and if you\u0026rsquo;re delivering hard news, you might not want to be smiling with a teethy grin.\nRight, kind of like this. But facial expressions also vary from culture to culture. In Latin America and Europe you\u0026rsquo;re going to be much more expressive than for example in Asia.\nAnything else that we should know in terms of gesture types?\nWell there\u0026rsquo;s one more that I haven\u0026rsquo;t spoken about and these are regulators. These are the gestures that you use in order to tell the audience what to do. They\u0026rsquo;re called regulators so it\u0026rsquo;s simply a case of: sit down, stand up, OK everybody please move to the other room. So these gestures are really about interacting and giving orders to the audience and I suppose something a teacher might use quite a lot.\nOK right such as… bring it down.\nOK, perfect!\nMichael, now we know what to do with our body, is there anything we should avoid?\nYes, there are certain gestures that we do that reflect or tell the audience about our negative inner states. These are called parasitical gestures and you should try to avoid them. Things such as playing with your hair or your clothes, wringing your hands together or or anything that\u0026rsquo;s giving those negative feelings away. You can get rid of them by just either working with a coach or just filming yourself and watching it back over to see what you need to eliminate. Pacing unnecessarily is another thing.\nExcellent stuff, thank you Michael. Now we know what to do with our bodies, what to avoid, is there any last tip to share with our viewers?\nAbsolutely. When in doubt, relax. Audiences love that.\nI love it!\nSo, three things to remember:\nOne, there are different types of gestures to use. Experiment. Two, avoid parasitical gestures, doing things unconsciously. Three, when in doubt, relax.\nThank you so much for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Even well-known tech conferences fail to engage their audiences all the time. But medical conferences can be among the worst. Check out this quick interview between Ideas on Stage, new partners with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, and Denise Silber to find out how to take medical (and other) events to the next level.\nOur friend Ross Fisher, a paediatric surgeon based in the UK, has had enough of poor medical communication, and when he’s not operating, he spends time educating doctors about a better way to present. There is a clear need, and Ross is making progress.\nIdeas on Stage has worked with many health-based conferences and events over the years, from internal events for pharma companies to open industry events in nephrology, oncology and other therapeutic areas. It’s clear that our approach to better presentations works very well in this field, and we’ve helped to design several very successful events.\nNow we are adding an extra string to our bow thanks to our partnership with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, run by Denise Silber, an experienced bilingual (English/French) event planner and Master of Ceremonies, who is specialized in healthcare communication, and helps organizers to build next-generation events and conferences with patients at the center.\nWe asked Denise some questions about medical conferences, and how our new partnership can help bring them to the next level.\n1. What is wrong with most medical conferences?\nDENISE SILBER: To start with, few physicians say they’re attending their conferences because of the content. They\u0026rsquo;re going to see their colleagues, to take a break from their routine, to visit a new city.\nIt’s a bit like going to the theater for the intermission. And when they do get in the conference room, it’s often “same old, same old”, with slide-based presentations and panels on usual topics or poster sessions…\nThe scientific committee that produces the agenda is likely not following what’s happening in communication and audio-visual techniques. The programs are often not addressing the big shifts in medicine with new technologies and the rise of start-ups, the new role of professionals and patients, the new ethical challenges. And to top it all off, much of the content is available to participants without physically attending.\n2. But surely people expect to sit there and receive lots of top-down detail - how best to meet their expectations while producing a 2.0 kind of conference?\nDS: Yes, people want to receive lots of top-down detail, but, as you know at Ideas on Stage, scientific content can be presented in an engaging or even captivating way.\nMy suggestion is not to change everything at once, but for organizers to go beyond the typical post-conference satisfaction survey and sit down and talk with participants to understand what they did and didn’t like, and then to run with some of the suggestions, to experiment on the least successful parts of their event.\n3. How important is it to include the patient’s point of view in medical events?\nDS: Inviting patients in from the beginning of the planning can make a huge difference. When physicians become patients, they are often very surprised by the experience in their own hospital.\nThe patient reminds us of the real-world viewpoint and of the basic mission of medicine, to help people. They bring irreplaceable testimony to the table. And their presence, both in the sessions and at the breaks, makes for a feel-good, human moment.\n4. What does Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You bring to medical conferences?\nDS: Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You brings new life to medical conferences, thanks to our extensive experience in producing exciting digital health events.\nEach of our clients’ conferences will have special needs and requirements, so we don’t have a formulaic approach. Services include: program and speaker consulting where we bring in novel topics, new speakers, formatting recommendations; creating engagement through a “challenge” or other activity that begins before the event, original demos, and social media articles and deployment. We can guide the conference to a « Patient-Included » certification, which can be transformative. This involves inviting patients to the organizing table, as part of the agenda, and in the room.\n5. Why partner with Ideas on Stage to help transform medical events?\nDS: This partnership is quite easy to understand. Ideas on Stage has extensive experience in business events, in presentation creation, and coaching public speakers in any industry. Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You is focused on healthcare, where we are recognized for producing quality programs related to the latest in digital innovation and involving patients. We each have an expertise that needs daily practice to stay in shape. Together we can make medical events even more original and powerful.\n6. Finally, if you had one piece of advice for event organizers, what would it be?\nDS: Advice for an event organizer in healthcare?

Ultimately, we were talking about inspiring a shift in culture. We gathered as much information as we could before wrapping up the meeting with quick sips of coffee to match Chavy’s speedster-pace.\nThis is how the project started — for us. But Chavy and his team had kicked-off planning the conference that summer, more than 8 months before the event would take place. Not everyone starts this well in advance. But let me assure you, it pays off.\nAt Ideas on Stage, we’ve had the pleasure of helping clients from practically all sectors bring creative and substantial presentations and events to life many times over. This was going to be a fun challenge given how out-of-the-box the client wanted to be in achieving the fundamental goals: inspire employee pride, reignite team unity and accelerate innovation to succeed in today’s world. Fueled up, we sent Chavy a proposal for our plan forward. He agreed and we put pedal to the metal.\nThe Challenge Normally, we need to consider some or all of the following elements in designing an event: budget, location, scheduling, possible discrepancies between organizers’ objectives and audience needs, overcoming bad presentation habits like death-by-PowerPoint, and harmonizing key messages across speakers and workshops.\nFor Mövenpick’s conference, our top risk was message-related. We needed to step out of ‘business as usual’, while not overstretching general managers’ sensibilities to create a snap-back. GMs impact everything from sales to front-office operations, so we needed to avoid the risk of destabilizing them and in turn, their team and guests. We needed to strike a warm tone with a clear ‘why’ supporting the call for a shift in culture. We needed to be glued to the question: what (in this culture shift) is in it for them?\nThe managers were coming from all around the world, an array of cultures and in many cases a relatively classic business paradigm. So, how would we effectively disrupt older assumptions and enroll them in an update across all touch-points in their hotels?\nThere were also scheduling and location constraints. Plus, conflicting conferences happening in the same time period, which GMs would need to attend. So how did we mitigate said risks and optimize opportunity in our planning?\nThe Solution Step one: align key stakeholders. To do this, we facilitated a full-day brainstorm in Geneva with their executive committee, or I should say, both of them. Chavy had recently engaged a shadow ExCom-Y team powered by millennials. During this synergistic gathering, Phil Waknell and I took the diverse group through Ideas on Stage methodology to synchronize objectives, distill key messages and capture creative ideas.\nThere were many questions to be asked, but first things first: we always start with our ABCs; of course I don’t mean the alphabet. We begin by gathering all there is to know regarding the specific Audience — the GMs in this case; their Burning Needs — what did they need out of this conference? And the Context — where and when exactly will the conference take place? Audience, Burning Needs, Context.\nSince that full day in Geneva it was clear we were working with a special group. Chavy and his team were not just talking about transformation, they were walking the change. To assure highest impact, they decided it was worth bringing in an external partner to keep things on target and provide fresh insight.\nThe day wrapped up with a succulent dinner in the heart of Geneva. (Mövenpick knows how to tie everything together with a beautiful moment.) This kind of generosity and attention to detail wove throughout the next 6 months until the final applause at the end of their conference.\nBetween that day and the event on April 25th, many steps were taken to ensure the success of this event. Here are the super six takeaways which you can put into practice now:\n Define a clear objective and tie it together with a theme. We decided early on about larger organizing elements, such as the theme of the conference, which would harmonize our main objective across a full 3-day line-up of presentations and workshops. We needed something that would inspire an internal culture change towards being faster, more connected, performance-oriented and having fun. A theme for rethinking the possible and changing gears with changing times. The theme: “SHIFT 2018” Add an inspirational gem. We gathered candidates for external speakers that would elevate our theme and draw insightful real-world connections. Who would represent best-in-class performance, efficiency, collaboration and all with a heart-pumping story of optimism and appetite for adventure? The speaker: ace solo sailor Alex Thomson, 2nd place Vendée Globe Champion Schedule and sync with presenters well in advance. To be sure all workshops and presentations were coherent, unique, memorable and impactful, we scheduled on average two hours of coaching with each contributor, of which there were a good 30 across the 2-day agenda. There were TED-inspired keynotes, panels, a live press briefing (one of the client’s many brilliant ideas), interactive workshops, and 10min lightning talks. The success of an event is determined before it begins. Given the packed agenda and the client’s commitment to success, we deployed the needed resources: two Speaker Coaches, a Master of Ceremonies, plus a Design Director all onsite for the entire event including rehearsals the day before. The takeaway: You can’t prepare too early, too well, or too much. Sprinkle on special touches. From the moment participants arrived the night before they were greeted with thoughtful gifts in their rooms, including products they were being asked to adopt in their hotels. There was also a surprise pair of Converse sports shoes, in the right size, which the normally shined-shoe crew were certainly not expecting. They were told that without their sneakers they couldn’t take a step into the conference. This was a true hit and left a memorable impression on everyone as a symbolic feature representing their unity as a team, accentuating the need for speed and fun. Other high-end touches included shifting gears on two F1 simulators, test-riding a pair of TESLA driverless cars and, to conclude the conference, an afternoon treasure-hunt that sent the whole 130-plus international pack out into the streets of Zurich to explore Movenpick’s Swiss roots at a competitive pace. The reviews: they laughed, they played, and they performed as a united global team. Add the unexpected. Make it memorable by making it meaningful, different and fun. Not every company or event will have a budget to offer gifts or to eat gourmet food and sip coffee-cocktails during breaks. However, that shouldn’t stop you from offering new experiences or thoughtful touches that “make moments” for your participants that are authentic to your culture. The tip: consider what matters to your team, then be generous. Visuals matter. Slide design and space were key in the success of this event. Too many conferences invest time and money in other important areas but forget the essential role of visuals to support key messages on stage. Movenpick limited text to under 10words/slide and asked presenters to make decks as graphic, clear and simple as possible. When speakers needed a creative boost, we were there to design and animate with them. The key: visuals matter, from slides to attire and certainly the event space.  Speaking of the actual space, Movenpick broke the mold and accentuated their culture shift within their hotel design by putting participants in a more modern yet homey setup. Couches and armchairs replaced stiff banquet seating, reflecting the future feel of their lobbies.\nEvents are not brain science. It’s about starting early and being thorough from the bottom to the top. You need the right materials and a clear plan to build a masterpiece.\nInvolve key stakeholders. Work from your core objectives and add layers of meaning and originality in stages. Above all, stay true to who you are as an organization. Authenticity is key.\nOne more thing. What made Movenpick’s SHIFT 2018 conference truly amazing, was that the leadership team and organizers continuously put themselves in the shoes of their audience: the GMs. They thought from their perspective and their needs. Serve your audience and you will smile at the results.\nChavy’s event team took risks to walk their talk: they were honest, dynamic and prepared enough to let loose on D-Day. It was clear that they were proud to work at Movenpick, and that pride was reflected in their audience.\nSo, in organizing your next event, we hope you feel clearer and more inspired about how to approach it. And, if you’d like some experienced partners to help guide you on the journey, you know where to find us.\nThe Results Here is a brief interview with Olivier Chavy two weeks after SHIFT 2018:\nHow did you feel the event went from a leadership perspective? The overall atmosphere of the conference was what we were most interested in and we wanted people to leave with the sensation ‘wow, I am really proud to work for this company’. The reactions we have received so far lead us to believe this was a mission accomplished!\nWhat did your general managers have to say about the event? The most common feedback has been that this was the best GM conference they have ever attended, which is fantastic. Most delegates commented that they liked the unusual format of short, sharp sessions – not too long sitting in a hall and no numbers presented.\nWhat made SHIFT a memorable experience? The whole ambiance made it memorable but there were a lot of memorable ‘little touches’ that came together to achieve this. From everyone wearing Converse high top shoes, to the newspaper we created, to the cool partners who presented, to the Swiss cow-bell awards…. We took some risks and did things differently and it paid off.\nWhen did you start planning the conference and why did you bring in Ideas on Stage to support you? We started planning initially in summer 2017 but the real work began in October/November that year. We decided to bring Ideas on Stage on board as we knew we didn’t want to do a ‘traditional’ conference and we would need professional assistance to stage manage, coach our speakers and plan the sessions.\nHow did working with Ideas on Stage help in realizing the event? It was critical – we would not have achieved the impact we did without them. Every one of our speakers was coached and guided into how to make the most of their session, all content was aligned to ensure the messages we wanted were passed, they came up with great ideas for transitions, flow of sessions, themes. We are really pleased we brought them on board.\nWere you surprised by any aspect of the event, before, during or after? We were surprised that we could enjoy it and not stress too much, it went really smoothly.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/15/2019-05-15-what-makes-an-amazing-culture-shifting-event/","summary":"","tags":["Events","Culture Shift","Tips","Learning","Case Study"],"title":"What Makes an Amazing, Culture-Shifting Event?"},{"author":"The Ideas on Stage team","contents":"A big part of the way many companies sell is to create a presentation that shows the complex benefits of the solution they are offering.\nBut even great businesses — which are very good at what they do — often lack the ability to clearly share their message to their target audience using presentations.\nThere are many reasons why people and companies want to improve their presentations but at the heart of it what they really want is to win more deals, get more customers and sell more.\nIn our 10-year experience of successfully helping many of the world’s leading companies sell more through radically better business presentations, there are three ingredients you must have in order to make effective presentations:\n1.

But I think it is sometimes given by coaches without thinking about the consequences, and that it can actually do more bad than good. Let me explain why.\nThe first reason is simply that not every speaker needs to speak slowly. Speaking slowly is done for several reasons, such as increasing the perceived gravitas (authority) or allowing the public to digest complex information more easily. But sometimes it’s simply not necessary and may actually reduce the effectiveness of the speech. If speaking fast is not detrimental to the clarity of the speech—that is, every word is easy to understand—and as long as the speed doesn’t make the amount of information unbearable for the listener, the first priority of a coach may not be to force a speaker to consciously slow down.\nThe second reason is that some people can be completely destabilized when forced to speak slower. It breaks a lot of things: the rhythm, the way words are articulated, the intonation, the energy in the voice, the link between the mouth muscles and the brain. This is why people who try to slow down may sound so awkward and unnatural. They are not used to it. It’s relatively easy to speak slower, it’s very hard to do so and remain natural and authentic.\nThe third reason why speaking slowly may not be good advice is that it may not be that relevant after all. The average speed at which orators speak has increased over time. Listen to a speech from Churchill, Martin Luther King or General de Gaulle and compare it to a recent speech, you should easily hear the dramatic difference in pace. Modern speeches tend to be delivered faster. Modern adverts or YouTubers speak even faster, yet manage to catch our attention and communicate clearly. Our era is so crowded with distractions every second of attention has become a luxury that cannot be wasted.\nFor master speakers, the ability to slow down or pick up pace naturally is extremely valuable, but it requires a lot of work and dedication. When there is little time to prepare, it’s more important to teach a speaker how to remain natural, authentic and passionate, and this is achieved much more easily by teaching how to speak in sync with the audience than to force someone to consciously slow down.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/07/2019-05-07-should-you-actually-slow-down-your-speech-when-you-present/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Tips"],"title":"Should you actually slow down your speech when you present?"},{"author":"","contents":"Powerful visuals come from powerful messages and clear visual ideas. But sometimes slides aren’t necessary. The days of ‘Death by PowerPoint®’ are over. Take 5 to discover the 3 simple steps to slide success that will help you achieve your objectives—and leave your audience wanting more—in our new episode of The Business Presentation Revolution podcast, with presentation experts Rose Bloomfield and Phil Waknell.\n  Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution: your colorful cocktail of presentation goodness.\nPhil: [00:00:06] Today we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on slides. Why most slides fail and three steps to make sure yours succeed.\nRose: [00:00:16] So today people really don\u0026rsquo;t like PowerPoint and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. In fact, maybe we should just stop using it?\nPhil: [00:00:24] Well we could and in fact a lot of presentations would work very well without any visual aids. And it\u0026rsquo;s much better for a presentation to have no slides than to have bad slides. But if people hate PowerPoint and the other slide technologies it\u0026rsquo;s not because of the technologies themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s because of the way they are used. And if you think that a good slide is just a whole bunch of bullet points behind you, well you can understand your audience not liking that. So, I think you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;throw out the baby with the bathwater\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not the tool, it\u0026rsquo;s the fool who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to use it that\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nRose: [00:01:01] Great. So Phil, you promised us three techniques for slide success. What\u0026rsquo;s the first one?\nPhil: [00:01:08] So the first one is to always remember that you\u0026rsquo;ve got to make sure you know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say before you start to think about your slides. The slides should illustrate what you\u0026rsquo;re saying. You are not there to comment on the slides that are behind you.\nRose: [00:01:25] OK. So first step: speech before slides. What\u0026rsquo;s the second step?\nPhil: [00:01:30] Well the second step is not to get your computer involved too early. In fact what you really need to do is to switch off your computer when you start thinking about the slides. You first think about the story, we\u0026rsquo;ve already done that. But then you think, \u0026ldquo;how do I want to illustrate that?\u0026rdquo; And you do it analog. You do it with some sticky notes or with a whiteboard or whatever, but then you can imagine what you would want to have as a visual aid to help your audience. And only then can you start designing it in your slide application of choice.\nRose: [00:02:04] Perfect. Okay, step one: speech before slides. Step two: analog storyboard first. In fact, at Ideas on Stage, the presentation directors or coaches tend to create a storyboard first, based on the key messages of our speakers, and then we deliver it to the designer. The designer is the one that makes it beautiful in PowerPoint only once we have a clear idea of where we\u0026rsquo;re going visually. So we have the first and second step. Phil, what\u0026rsquo;s our third step?\nPhil: [00:02:33] Well the third step, Rose, is absolutely to remember that slides are not documents. So yesterday I was giving a class for a business school and one of the people in the audience said that she really hates it when people confuse slides and documents. When they confuse PowerPoint with Word. And this is a problem. We often produce really bad slides because we think we can kill two birds with one stone. Like the slide that is going to be on the wall behind us while we\u0026rsquo;re speaking is also a document that we can distribute before or during or after the presentation. And you know what? Slides don\u0026rsquo;t make good documents and documents don\u0026rsquo;t make good slides. The more text you put up there in an attempt to make it useful for someone reading afterwards, well you know what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen? The audience will try to read; and human beings cannot read and listen at the same time. Right?\nRose: [00:03:31] Absolutely.\nPhil: [00:03:32] Not even ladies can do that Rose, can they?\nRose: [00:03:34] No, I know we\u0026rsquo;re great multitaskers, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty hard to do both at the same time. So we have three successful steps for designing effective slides. One: speech before the slides. Two: analog storyboard first. Three: don\u0026rsquo;t confuse your slides with a document. So separate those two.\nPhil: [00:03:57] So once we\u0026rsquo;ve understood that your slides are only visual aids during our presentation and that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to distribute them because we have documents, well then we can design them effectively. But that is for another show.\nRose: [00:04:10] So thank you for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We have a lot more to share with you about delivery and slides.

Now, Gizmodo is not exactly known as a staple of great journalism, but sometimes they have a knack to hit the nail on the head. In this case, the fact that for several years Elon Musk repeatedly promised—and failed to deliver—full autonomous driving. Honestly, s eeing how hard it is to achieve full autonomy, and how many problems are left with Tesla’s current autopilot system, it is hard to believe these new promises will actually materialize.\nBut what interests me here is the relationship between what we promise and how that affects our credibility. Whenever we present, it’s easy and sexy to (over) sell grand visions of a glorious future. It makes us feel good to be that visionary genius. There’s just one problem. If we don’t deliver, then we’re just freeing a pack of wild dogs that one day will come back to bite us. This is exactly the trap in which Elon Musk has fallen.\nHe is not alone. During his first tenure at Apple, Steve Jobs was known for always over-inflating sales predictions, and failing to meet them. The lackluster sales of Macintosh compared to his promises were one of the reasons for his downfall. It would take him another failure, NeXT, and again another one with the Mac Cube, to drastically change his approach and start to under-promise, over-deliver.\nThe overpromise, under-deliver approach is typical of startups, because the competition is so fierce to stand out and gain an edge against the competition that it is sometimes necessary to have blind faith in your own vision. But Tesla is not a little startup anymore, and Elon Musk needs to change the way he communicates about it. He should start to under-promise and over-deliver. If he does so, it will be very easy for him to reclaim the lost credibility.\nHe’s totally capable of it. In fact, what is truly confounding is that he is already doing it brilliantly with Space X. He’s achieved a huge breakthrough in space technology, yet does not hesitate to warn before each launch that chances of failure remain extremely high. Under-promise, over-deliver.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/30/2019-04-30-is-elon-musk-running-out-of-credibility/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Business"],"title":"Is Elon Musk running out of credibility?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"This is a quick list of seven common problems that we see with slides created by non specialists. However they are relatively easy to spot, and you don’t have to be a graphic designer to avoid them. Read on and your next slides will look much better!\n Too much content. The goal is not to cover every single inch with content. It’s not because you have some space left at the bottom of the slide that you should put something there. Leave ample white space, let your content breathe, it will give it importance. Irrelevant content. Now that you removed clutter, it’s time to ask yourself if the remaining content is really, really, really necessary and relevant to your presentation and to what you are going to say. Irrelevant content will just distract and confuse your audience. Content is too small. The basic rule is: if it’s too small to be readable, don’t put it on the slide. What’s the point of adding text in 9 points that nobody will be able to read? Even if relevant, if it cannot be read by your audience then it’s just visual noise. When designing your slides, take the size of the room and of the screen into account. If you are young don’t forget that older people often don’t see as well as you do, and need bigger text and graphics. Illogical visual flow. We have seen slides that put the key information in the bottom right corner. Or slides that had to be read bottom to top. Try to avoid those layouts if possible, in Western culture it’s preferable to put the most important elements at the top or center of the slide. Insufficient contrast. What looks legible on your high quality screen may look washed out on old projectors or brightly lit rooms. Always make sure that you have excellent contrast between background and content. Avoid busy backgrounds which reduce legibility. Don’t forget that white text, not colored text, is what offers the highest contrast on a dark background. Boring looking. You will just make your life unnecessary hard if you try to use boring, plain slides to keep your audience interested. Using beautiful pictures, original graphics, a small dose of animation and a few surprises will be much more efficient! Comic Sans. Please, don’t use that font. Even as a joke. Just don’t.

She’s the author of the Pyramid Principle, a book that was long considered, and sometimes still is, the gold standard of presentation structuring in the consulting industry. But it was back in the eighties. So I’ll dare to ask the question: is the pyramid principle outdated?\nIf you’re not familiar with the pyramid principle, it is a method to lay out the information in a presentation in the most efficient way possible, based on how people with little time, especially executives, absorb information. For example, one of the key techniques is to start by presenting the conclusion first, because the CEO doesn’t want to wait until the end to understand where you’re going. This, and the other techniques in the book, are still valid. They still work today. However, they are no longer sufficient to win the deal in the twenty-first century. Let me explain why.\nThe pyramid principle is an extremely logical approach. But recent research, and honestly, what the best presenters and showmen have always known, is that presentations need more than logic and information. They need emotion to be truly effective and have a lasting impact. This is where the pyramid principle falls short. We’re not just brains. We’re living humans, with our knowledge, our beliefs, our feelings, our emotions, our hopes, our fears. None of these parts can work independently from the others. Seemingly innocuous information can create fear or hope. Our audience’s beliefs—for example that centralization is a good or bad thing—can hugely influence the outcome of a presentation.\nThis is the key reason why we developed the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool, to make sure that presentations don’t treat an audience as a collection of isolated brains, but as what they are: humans. Let me show you how much of a difference that makes by going quickly through the four areas that the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool addresses:\n What people know: this is the rational information. It’s what the pyramid principle does brilliantly. What people think: this is what people think they know, but hasn’t been backed by facts. It touches on our beliefs, the rumor we heard, the “fact” that was repeated but never demonstrated. If you take the time to adapt your communication to what people think, you will instantly understand how to overcome some of the mental blocks of your audience. No more frustration because people seem to be totally deaf to your recommendations. What people feel: can you imagine how many politicians, how many top CEOs, how many celebrities would have been saved from huge embarrassment, or worse, from a debacle, if they had taken the time to take their audience’s feelings into account before speaking. What people do: too many presentations stop at “we said what we wanted to say.” It’s completely insufficient. This is what leads to: “Our presentation was great but they didn’t do what we expected” (didn’t buy, didn’t implement, didn’t sign off, didn’t whatever you wanted). But if you take the time to clearly define what you want people do after the presentation, then you can have a plan.  The pyramid principle is an excellent tool to communicate logical information, but it doesn’t really take into account how humans actually work. It’s like trying to drive a car by just steering the wheel with the engine shut off. It’s not going to get you very far. By addressing your audience as humans, not machines, you will dramatically increase your chances of reaching your goal.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/16/2019-04-16-is-barbara-minto-s-pyramid-principle-outdated/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling","Consulting","Business"],"title":"Is Barbara Minto’s pyramid principle outdated?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Recently my computer, a MacBook Pro, needed to be repaired. I had to do without a laptop for several weeks. And of course, during those weeks I needed to present with slides. Luckily, with my iPhone and a couple of accessories I had everything I needed:\n A (not too old) iPhone or iPad A lightning to HDMI adapter A lightning power cable and brick (using the HDMI adapter drains the battery fast). Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for iOS Optionally, a Logitech Spotlight remote.  Both Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote work like their computer cousins, and support all animations. I loaded my presentation on my iPhone, connected it to the screen using the HDMI adapter, and voilà! Probably the fastest and easiest way to project something. Even cooler, the iPhone supports the Logitech Spotlight presentation remote via Bluetooth, so I could use it to go advance the slides.\nThe only downside is that an iPhone screen is very small for my old eyes, and I had to turn my back to the audience from time to time to see where I was in the presentation. But it worked flawlessly.\nIf you have a critical presentation to deliver, using your iPhone as a backup is an excellent way to fight Murphy’s Law, and have a safety net in case something goes wrong with your computer.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/09/2019-04-09-use-your-iphone-as-backup-for-important-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Microsoft PowerPoint","Apple Keynote","iPhone"],"title":"Use your iPhone as backup for important presentations"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Seth Godin coined the term “meatball sundae” several years ago in a book that explained that putting two great things together does not always create something better. And in the worst case, such as a meatball sundae, it can actually create something nobody wants.\nThe meatball sundae presentation effect can happen at two levels: at the event level, and at the individual presentation level.\nLet’s take Apple’s latest keynote as an example of the meatball sundae effect at the event level. Apple is a great meatball. Hollywood A-stars are great sundaes. But put together, the tastes of the two clashed in a way that was obvious to the most casual observers.\nWe can all learn something from what happened. Apple failed to create a fantastic event with the appearance of stars such as Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston. In fact, it was a worse event compared to their usual standards. So why would hiring a star magically turn our events into something fantastic? The answer is simple: it doesn’t. More prestigious? Yes. Better and more interesting? Not necessarily.\nA star can make your event better, if, and that’s a big if, properly selected and prepared. This is why, whenever we design an event, we take extra steps to ensure that your A-list guests do not taste like the meatball in the sundae. We check that they are willing to do their homework, prepare properly and that they will adapt to your audience. This makes a world of difference.\nAt the individual presentation level, the meatball sundae effect is very real too, especially when we try to cram to much stuff into too little time. Does the presentation deliver information that is at the same time too complex for non-experts and too simple for real experts? Meatball sundae presentation. Is the storyline trying to follow too many different structures and logical paths? Meatball sundae story. Does it mix different visual styles that don’t go well together? Meatball sundae slides.\nMeatball sundae presentations are often the consequence of a poorly done ABC: knowing who the Audience is (A), what are their Burning needs (B) and what is the general Context (C). These elements have to be crystal clear before working on the story, or the presentation will lack focus and seem out of place.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/02/2019-04-02-the-meatball-sundae-presentation-e/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Preparation"],"title":"The meatball sundae presentation effect"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"It may sound weird, but this is a question we get asked from time to time: “Do you know a prescription drug that would help me reduce my stress on stage?”\nWe’re not talking about illegal drugs, but legal drugs sold in pharmacies. There are a lot of those designed by pharmaceutical companies to reduce stress, anxiety, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, etc. We are not doctors, so we cannot say anything about them from a medical perspective. But in the context of presentations, we don’t recommend any. We met a few people who unfortunately thought they couldn’t do without them. Looking back at their performance, we don’t think the drugs had any positive effect. They may have thought that it improved their performance on stage, but it didn’t. As the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Nile Rodgers once explained in an interview in the Guardian:\n “(…) My drugs made me think it was amazing. The people freaking out made me think it was amazing. My beautiful date made me think it was amazing. But the tapes don’t lie. It was not amazing. (\u0026hellip;)” —Nile Rodgers\n Of course Nile Rodgers was probably referring to something a bit stronger than Aspirin, but his lesson remains true for any kind of stage performance. Great presentation delivery requires your full presence and an authentic connection with the audience. Drugs will only set you off balance and give you a distorted view of reality, preventing you from being yourself, centered and focused on the moment.\nIn fact, you already may be taking a drug that makes things worse: coffee. Find out why that’s not a good idea in this short podcast.\nAfter working with thousands of speakers, our message is clear: you don’t need drugs to present successfully, but you do need energy. A good presentation coach will help you turn your fear into positive energy, helping you achieve full presence on stage, and giving your messages the power they—and your audience—deserve.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/03/26/2019-03-26-is-there-a-drug-to-get-rid-of-my-fear-of-public-speaking/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear","Stage fright"],"title":"Is there a drug to get rid of my fear of public speaking?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"It’s a trick I learned when studying how movies and TV shows are written. You don’t do a flash back, you do a flash present. For presentations, that means that you don’t tell the story as something that is over; that makes the audience passive. Instead, you bring the scene from the past into the present, or you bring the audience to the past, and tell it as if it is happening right now. This allows the audience to actively relive the scene as it happened, and is a much more effective way to tell stories.\nLet me give you an example to show you the difference. Imagine you want to talk about that “aha” moment you had several years ago when you found the big idea to create your company.\nFirst, the flash back version, told as something that happened in the past: “In 2005, I had the idea to create my company. It was about creating a platform to engage users by sharing social content based on pictures only. I had the idea during a discussion with two friends. At the time most social platforms forced users to use text…”\nNow the flash present version, told as something happening now: “let’s all go back to 2005. I am having a beer with two friends. I’m complaining about how social media forces me to write something for every post. One of my friends, you know, the blunt one, tells me ‘then why don’t you create a platform where it is impossible to write something?’”…\nNote that it is possible to use the past tense (I was having a discussion…) as long as you make the public relive the scene instead of telling about it as something that is over. Where a flashback is factual and flat, a flash present is engaging and dynamic. For master storytellers, each detail matters. This technique makes a big difference when engaging your audience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/03/19/2019-03-19-in-presentations-dont-do-a-flash/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling","Tips"],"title":"In presentations, don’t do a flash back, do a flash present"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"This March Andrea Pacini joined Ideas on Stage as UK Presentation Director, meaning that Ideas on Stage now has a direct presence in France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom - and we serve the rest of the world from these four locations.\nWe sat down with Andrea for a short interview.\nQ: What is your background? A: I am Italian, and I studied in Italy and Ireland. I then did an internship in Cambridge, where I fell in love with the UK and decided to stay there. I’ve been living in London for 6 years now. From a professional perspective, my background is sales and business development for international companies. In parallel I have worked to help others deliver great presentations.\nQ: What made you so interested in helping others deliver great presentations? A: The moment was ten years ago, when I read Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds. This is when I realized there was so much more than just PowerPoint. But more than that, I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur. As a kid, I used to follow people like Richard Branson, trying to learn the tips and tricks to be successful. I still read a lot of business books. I then realized that all great entrepreneurs are top communicators. And that’s when I switched my interest from pure entrepreneurship to presentations. It then led me to the realization that most business presentations suck! This is why I decided to help business people improve their presentations. What really fires me up, my passion, is the place where business intersects with communication.\nQ: What made you want to join the Ideas on Stage team? A: Like I said, Presentation Zen helped to open my eyes to what the potential of a well thought out and designed presentation could look like. Fine. But the entrepreneur in me wanted to apply this wisdom in business situations. This is how I came to discover Ideas on Stage. With their business backgrounds, Pierre and Phil and their great team pioneered the path of taking Presentation Zen principles and applying them to the entrepreneurial and business space. This ticked both my boxes. Then as a bonus, I discovered the close relationship between Garr and Ideas on Stage. So when I finally decided to turn my presentation hobby into a new career, joining Ideas on Stage was the best-case scenario for me. And I was right – we are so closely aligned that it seems like we have been working together for many years already.\nQ: Do you prefer to work with smaller or bigger companies? A: It doesn’t really matter, I love to work with both! The challenges are different, but all companies, regardless of their size, have a big weakness in the preparation phase. Everybody starts working on their presentation by opening PowerPoint, and forget that they first have to know what their objective is, identify the key messages and build a storyline before working on the slides.\nQ: Do you think the preparation phase is where most companies fail? A: Definitely. You really have to start by understanding who is your audience, what do they want from you, what’s the context of the presentation, what’s your objective, how are you going to brainstorm to refine your key messages? The preparation phase is really where the magic happens. Especially in large companies, people think a presentation is a bunch of bullet points in PowerPoint.\nQ: Is there anything companies could learn from events like TEDx? A: Oh yes, TEDx has been instrumental in helping to improve presentations. So why not take the ingredients that make a TEDx speech so engaging, and apply them to your business presentations? Business presentations don’t have to be boring! Of course a successful boardroom presentation won’t be exactly like a TEDx talk, but like TEDx it should be short, simple, well-structured, with good use of examples, and delivered convincingly.\nQ: Something else you are passionate about? A: I love craft beer! You know, beers produced by microbreweries. Just like every presentation should be original and different, with a focus on quality not quantity, I think the same way about beer! I love to discover different beers, and I go to beer tours to find new and original tastes.\nThank you and welcome Andrea, we’re delighted to have you on board.

Join Rose as she discusses a foolproof process to prepare a presentation with Phil Waknell, Co-Founder and Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage.\n  Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your quick coffee break to learn how to shake up and wake up your presentations. [00:00:06][5.8]\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at one of the smallest but most important changes you can make to make a huge difference in your presentations. And it\u0026rsquo;s all about putting “the horse” before “the cart”. [00:00:16][9.5]\nRose: [00:00:20] You just mentioned “carts” and “horses”: what does that have to do with presentations? [00:00:24][3.4]\nPhil: [00:00:25] Well Rose, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard the expression \u0026lsquo;putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;, which is generally something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. But that\u0026rsquo;s what we do all the time when we\u0026rsquo;re preparing presentations. The typical way to prepare a business presentation is: \u0026ldquo;Oh no, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do a presentation. Tomorrow. And it\u0026rsquo;s 11:30 at night. OK, so I am going to open my computer. I am going to type my PowerPoint slides and 50 slides later, I then think, OK, maybe I need some extra sub-bullets or whatever.\u0026quot; And then what happens is the next day you get into the meeting room, you say hi to everybody, you connect your computer, you start showing your slides, you turn your back on the audience, you read your bullet points, and then you improvise because you haven\u0026rsquo;t prepared what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say. You end up with a whole lot of information and it\u0026rsquo;s boring as hell for the participants. I mean, how do you feel when you\u0026rsquo;re in that audience? [00:01:15][50.3]\nRose: [00:01:17] Well, unfortunately, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been there before and you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the emails you still have to answer.

So you think you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared the presentation but actually you\u0026rsquo;ve not. You\u0026rsquo;ve just prepared some bullet points, which your audience is going to hate and which they\u0026rsquo;re going to forget very quickly. So that is not a proper preparation, but it is ‘putting the cart before the horse'. So, if you think about it, ‘putting the cart before the horse’ is going through the process in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is putting the horse before the cart and that means we need to work out what we have to say to our audience, and then afterwards we think: \u0026ldquo;do I need to illustrate that? And if so, how?\u0026rdquo; So preparation for a presentation, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve got limited time - because people always say to us: \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to prepare my presentation properly, so I just have to prepare my slides.\u0026rdquo; No. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a short time, then what you should do is to be thinking: Who is my audience? What are their needs? What are my objectives? And what are the few things they need to remember a week later for me to achieve those objectives? And then you\u0026rsquo;ve got your key messages. You understand your objectives, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have slides you\u0026rsquo;re prepared. If you have your slides but you don\u0026rsquo;t know your key messages, you\u0026rsquo;re not prepared. [00:02:44][74.2]\nRose: [00:02:45] That\u0026rsquo;s it. And luckily we face this all the time at Ideas on Stage, so we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a very simple four step process. One: you ideate. What is this going to be about? What do I need to say? Like Phil mentioned: objectives, key messages. Two: you need to create your presentation. Write it out. Write your storyline. Three: ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I need illustrations? Do I need slides?\u0026rdquo; If you do then you make them! If you don\u0026rsquo;t, fine. Especially in those tight moments when you only have one night to prepare, you might not need the slides. Four: delivery; speaking. That\u0026rsquo;s when you can start to time yourself and check if you know what you need to say ahead. And your audience will thank you. [00:03:31][46.7]\nPhil: [00:03:32] That makes a huge, huge difference. So I will always say rehearsal is necessary. Slides are optional. So if you go into a meeting, if you go into a presentation and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any PowerPoint slides but you do have clear messages and you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable in front of your audience because you have rehearsed it two, three, four, five times then your audience will actually enjoy that far more than a whole load of bullet points behind you. [00:04:00][27.7]\nRose: [00:04:00] Yep. So let\u0026rsquo;s put the \u0026lsquo;horse BEFORE the cart\u0026rsquo;. Prepare. You\u0026rsquo;ve got Ideation, Creation, maybe Illustration and then Speaking and you\u0026rsquo;ll be set. [00:04:09][8.8]\nPhil: [00:04:10] As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u0026rdquo; Creating a lot of slides and bullet points without knowing what you want to say is not preparation, that\u0026rsquo;s an absence of preparation. So if you prepare it properly, if you go into the meeting knowing what you need to say, knowing your objectives, even without slides, you will succeed and your audience will thank you.

This is the reason you, and not somebody else, is on stage to deliver the presentation. The second stake is about your audience: why is it important for them? This is the reason why your audience is there to listen to you instead of doing something else. This is why they should care about your topic. The third stake is about everyone else: why does it truly matter outside of the audience and you? What is the impact of your topic on the world?  If you forget the first stake, then you will not feel engaged. If you forget the second stake, then your audience will not be interested. If you forget the third stake, then nobody else will care about your presentation.\nTake for example a talk about the environmental impact of plastic bottles. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care about that topic, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the first stake. Most probably you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be on stage. The second stake is about \u0026ldquo;why is the topic of plastic bottles important for you, the audience?\u0026rdquo; Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s so we each realize how much plastic we waste each year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because it has direct consequences on our health. The third stake brings perspective. It shows that the problem is not just about a bunch of people in the room, but impacts everyone, even living organisms that are located thousands of kilometers from where the bottle was thrown away. These organisms are essential for our own survival.\nGreat presentations are delivered by someone who cares, to people who will care, about something worth caring about. If the stakes are low, nothing much will happen. If all three stakes are high, then you give yourself a chance of making an impact.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/03/05/2019-03-05-triple-stakes-of-great-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Storytelling"],"title":"The triple stakes of great presentations"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"“Don’t worry, I’m experienced, I speak at conferences all the time!” How many times have we heard that sentence from speakers who never did a TEDx style talk, yet think that, because of experience, they can just wing it? For us, it’s not reassuring. Quite the opposite, it’s a clear warning sign that the speaker doesn’t really know what is expected of him. Here are five warning signs that give you clues that your speaker may not be ready to give a TEDx style talk.\n Thinking that traditional speaking experience can replace TEDx specific preparation. We’ve seen many speakers who were very good at giving unstructured talks, or 1h presentations, or improvise during a round table. But giving a TEDx Talk requires a whole different level of commitment and preparation. Make sure your speaker understands what is expected of him. Constantly changing the key topic, storyline or angle. Some speakers seem to be unable to discipline themselves to stick to the planned storyline. They constantly change their mind. After several weeks of preparation they come up with draft version 2453 of their talk, but it’s not better than draft version 1. And on D Day, they want to change their story again. Not putting in the necessary hours to prepare. Nobody can deliver a breakthrough talk without preparing and rehearsing properly. It’s just not possible. Those speakers doing OK Without preparation? They just rehash what they usually say. They don’t cover new ground. They don’t bring new ideas to the table. They just missed a big opportunity to innovate. Not wanting to adapt his presentation. Some speakers are unwilling to move away from what they usually do. Because of the fear of the unknown, the fear of change, or just plain stubbornness. They may not be the best person to speak at your TEDx event. Too passionate to keep an open mind. I have seen several activists who were so passionate about the cause they were defending that they couldn’t conceive others did not necessarily share their views. They spoke passionately about their fight, de facto excluding everyone who didn’t share their point of view, and creating a feeling of aggression in the majority of the public.  In collaboration with the presentation directors, the curator of the event has the responsibility to look for these clues, and if necessary axe the speaker from the program. It’s much better to remove one speaker from the show, even if he’s already announced on the program, than take the risk of a disaster on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/26/2019-02-26-5-warning-signs-someone-is-not-ready-for-ted/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"5 warning signs someone is not ready to speak at your TEDx event"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"If you’re a Startup founder, you’ve heard this all before. “Your elevator pitch should be able to convince anyone in 30 seconds in an elevator”.

There is one other person in it, who you don’t know, and that person is looking intensely at you. You find it weird and you feel a bit uncomfortable. But the worst is yet to come.

We saw that the best way to fend them off is to strengthen your vital space anchor. But how can you do that?\nIf your presentation has an objective, a clear message, it is much easier to use it as an anchor. Let’s imagine for example that the key message is that your presentation is about a new software service that offers necessary services to protect your IT systems. But the vultures—who don’t really understand what it’s about—are out to eat the tech guy. They question every choice, every detail, every functionality. The presentation turns into an endless discussion of details. If that happens, re-anchor the presentation. Remind them of the objective, the message: “Yes, we can discuss about whether we can add the animated dog on the configuration page later, but this is secondary. What is really important is that we guarantee that we have the right level of protection, and this is the best tool to do it.”\nBullies also like to behave like spoiled children. They throw themselves on the ground, kicking and screaming (mostly figuratively, I haven’t seen someone actually throw himself on the ground—that would have been interesting—but I heard plenty of people screaming to try to cover the sound of their incompetence). They won’t take no as an answer. You know what? No is exactly the answer they need, with a short sentence explaining the consequences, no more. For example: “No, we cannot add this because this would increase the budget / increase the risk / increase delivery time.” The longer your justification is, the more it becomes self-justification, the weaker it becomes, the more mouth-watering you become to the vultures. Be sure to do this only for unjustified requests, not for legitimate concerns or needs. Instead of being the prey, you become the bully’s super nanny. You’re the adult in the room, anchored, with a good message to defend. When you do that, something funny happens. Most bullies instinctively understand they’re starting to look immature and are going to lose their power, and they calm down by themselves. Only the slower ones don’t get it. Be kind to them.\nThe vultures will also try to destabilize you with questions you don’t have the answer. Although not being able to answer any question means you’re not prepared properly (and in that case that’s your problem, not the bully’s problem), it’s perfectly fine and normal not to have 100% of the answers. Just say it. “I don’t have the answer, we will test it and I will come back to you.” See? That simple. You even behaved proactively by proposing to find the answer to the question.\nThese are only a few examples of the techniques you can use to get out of a presentation slump and gain confidence. Anybody willing to invest the time and effort can change and become a good presenter. This is also what a good coach can do for you. He can help you anchor yourself so Vultures will start starving and look elsewhere. He can help you learn to stay firm in hostile environments. He can help you become the good leader people want to follow.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/12/2019-02-12-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-2/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 2)"},{"author":"","contents":"The secret ingredient in any presentation is Your Audience. Don’t forget to ask these essential questions to be sure you don’t fail before you’ve even started to speak.\n  Transcript Phil: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your double espresso of presentation know-how.\nRose: [00:00:05] This episode is all about the magic ingredient in any presentation: Your Audience.\nPhil: [00:00:12] So Rose, when I ask people what they hate most about presentations, one thing that comes up all the time is that they hate it when they\u0026rsquo;re receiving a standard presentation, which just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it is suited to that audience.\nRose: [00:00:27] Exactly, Phil. I often think of it like Christmas. So think of your presentation like a gift. Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at Christmas and you\u0026rsquo;re opening your gift and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. You pull off the bow and you look around and at the same time you all pull out\u0026hellip; the same pair of socks. And you realize, \u0026ldquo;Mom, you probably could have done better than all of us having the same pair of socks.\u0026rdquo;\nRose: [00:00:49] Maybe when you\u0026rsquo;re giving gifts you think about what would actually mean something to your grandmother and what would actually mean something to your kids. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;the socks.” So Phil, we have some methodology we use at Ideas on Stage that helps us think about the necessary questions to prepare a presentation for an audience. Can you tell us about that?\nPhil: [00:01:08] Absolutely Rose. So we always start with the ABC. Audience. Burning need. Context. It\u0026rsquo;s the first step. It\u0026rsquo;s so important. And most presenters don\u0026rsquo;t do it. So first off: who is your audience? And you need to get to know your audience beyond simply the title on their business card. Who are they really? I had one chief executive who came to me for example for help with a presentation at a conference and I asked him, \u0026ldquo;So, who\u0026rsquo;s in the audience?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;OK well come back when you do because I can\u0026rsquo;t help you to prepare a successful presentation if we don\u0026rsquo;t know who the audience is.\u0026rdquo; Because the audience is the magic ingredient. So the second part then is the burning need.\nRose: [00:01:53] Oh yes. Your example makes me think. I was working with someone the other day as well and I asked, \u0026ldquo;So, when you\u0026rsquo;re preparing this presentation, what is your team expecting from you in the presentation? Do they need to know numbers? Do they need some moral support? Do they need some reassurance?\u0026rdquo; I looked at him: “[he said] I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Same thing. I said, \u0026ldquo;Okay can you find out? Because this is what\u0026rsquo;s going to guide you in preparing an effective presentation.\u0026rdquo; What are their needs from you? Of course, what is your objective? But what are they expecting?\nPhil: [00:02:27] Yes, you\u0026rsquo;ve always got to start from where they are. That\u0026rsquo;s vital. So often when we\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC with a client they will find that they actually ****don\u0026rsquo;t know some of this information, but they know that they need to find it out. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just asking the right questions. So the \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; then is for context. This is all about how long the presentation is supposed to be. Will there be questions and answers afterwards? Is there somebody else presenting before? If so, what are they presenting? Is there someone presenting afterwards? What time of day is it going to be? For example, is it first thing in the morning? Which is good for getting people to really understand things. Is it first thing in the afternoon? In which case, good luck… All of these things: the technology you have available. Do you have a projector? Do you have sound? Lots of different questions that will help you to understand the context. It\u0026rsquo;s also your audience\u0026rsquo;s business context: is their business going well? Is it not going well? Where are they in the financial cycle? In the sales context: do they already have a supplier? Do they already work with you? All of these things you need to know. And you\u0026rsquo;ll find that when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC it\u0026rsquo;s always just asking the simple but really important questions. And it\u0026rsquo;s the five most important minutes that you can ever spend when preparing a presentation.\nRose: [00:03:45] Excellent Phil. When is this presentation going to happen? Who is it with? I completely agree. So remember: this is not your presentation, it\u0026rsquo;s theirs. The magic ingredient in any presentation is: the Audience. Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s the magic ingredient in your presentation.\nPhil: [00:04:06] Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We\u0026rsquo;ve got so much more to share.

You didn’t manage to shake off your nerves. You became confused. The client or your boss criticized you. Maybe you’ve been caught in a downward spiral for some time, each criticism making you lose confidence, and making the next presentation worse. I have good news for you: no matter what your situation is, this vicious circle can be broken, and you gain the necessary confidence to enjoy presenting.\nHaters are going to hate Before I explain how, let’s put things into context. Haters are going to hate. Some people have a psychological problem, and are there to put others down. This can be to mask their own insecurities and problems, or it can be because they like to bully others. Unfortunately, those types seem to thrive in certain work environments. Stop feeling guilty right now because of these people. They are the ones who have a problem, not you. If that describes your boss, he’s not behaving like the leader he could be. If that describes your client, he does not behave like the competent client he could be. I’m fine with people giving me blunt, critical but honest feedback, even if it may be hard to hear. But I won’t accept people using criticism and attacks to put others down, and nobody should. I will also give you another secret: these vultures are really not that strong. They build their power on charm, fear and submission. But they are hated by everyone. Their subordinates. Their fellow managers or C-level executives. Even their bosses hate them. At the first opportunity everybody will jump ship and abandon them. Once you start to understand that, they are really not that fearsome anymore.\nI started by addressing this point because, in my experience, this is really the factor that makes people doubt themselves and lose their presentation powers. In a secure environment, you feel alright, but as soon as you see the shadows of the vultures circling above your head, you lose confidence. Vultures? Yes, that’s exactly what they are! They are scavengers, they like to prey on perceived weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but they’re really not that courageous. To starve the vultures, you just need to show you are alive and ready to stand firm. How? By strengthening your anchor in your vital space.\nThe goal of the vultures is to reduce your vital space or push you out of it. The vultures are circling around your vital space, they are always trying to invade it by stealing your energy and confidence. It’s only a facade. If you remain anchored, your vital space will protect you and you will be able to fend off all threats with calm and confidence. It will become a natural part of your presentations. Being able to jump out of your vital space is useful, but don’t do it before you have the confidence to do so and learn to do it without turning into a vulture.\nIn the second part I will explain several techniques to stay anchored and protect your vital space, and scare off the presentation vultures.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/05/2019-02-05-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-1/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear","Business"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 1)"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"A few weeks ago, Ideas on Stage had the privilege of organizing a sales presentation training for Krauthammer at Dolce La Hulpe, close to Brussels in Belgium. For us, delivering a training for dozens of senior people at Krauthammer, one of the world’s most respected sales and management training companies, felt like designing something for Jonathan Ive, Apple’s legendary designer: a bit intimidating but incredibly exciting.\nThe training met with great success, and it was fantastic to work with such talented people, but what I will remember most are two presentations. During the hands-on course, groups prepared a sales pitch, and at the end of the day, each group had to deliver its presentation in front of the others.\nThe first group was stunning! The beginning of the presentation used the music from “Also sprach Zarathustra” from Richard Strauss, the piece you hear in the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey when mankind discovers the use of tools. Not speaking at all, just pointing to a few words at a time on the slides to deliver his key message. He had his audience’s attention fully captured!\nBoy, was the second group in trouble. How can you beat such a brilliant presentation? Well, the second presenter calmly and confidently went on stage. And started singing the tune of “Also sprach Zarathustra” live! Everybody, impressed by his boldness and his clever and humorous improvisation, feeling fully connected and present, started singing along. Using great body language to increase the dramatic effect, he stole the show. After doing this he simply said “This is how we do it at Krauthammer. We don’t do playback, we always do it live!” Everybody laughed and had a great time. This is exactly the kind of presentation they will still remember and talk about next year, whereas countless other boring presentations will have been long forgotten.\nThey probably won’t do that in front of a real client. But they will remember the need to be memorable. By default, your audience will forget everything you say—fast. It’s up to you to find a way to make your messages stick.

Yet my point is that in a debate it is extremely important to listen and move with a maximum of agility, and talk with a maximum of punch.\nTake the example of the Gilets jaunes controversy in France. The government was completely taken by surprise by the popularity of the movement. Their initial listening position lacked agility and guile. They were perceived as static, which gave the impression, justified or not, that they were not listening at all. Their counters used words that didn’t have any punch, believing that the threat would disappear by itself.\nOnly after receiving glancing blows to the head did they start to realize how serious their situation was, and how much their strength had already been sapped. The president tried to counter. He had good arguments and gave away a lot, but only got more attacks in return. Why? Because he used his arguments inefficiently. Instead of using them in a way that would have made the movement pause and doubt, he threw away his best shots, he gave the impression he was losing, and that gave more confidence and energy to his opponents.\nWhen under attack, if you counter weakly, it only strengthens your opponent and saps your morale. Start by floating (listening) like a butterfly, put yourself in a favorable position, then sting (speak) like a bee when the time is right.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/22/2019-01-22-listen-like-a-butterfly-talk-like-a-bee/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali","Tips"],"title":"Listen like a butterfly, talk like a bee"},{"author":"","contents":"Rose asks Phil how to overcome your fear before a big presentation, and turn it into positive energy on stage.

Phil, is everything okay?\nPhil: I\u0026rsquo;m just really feeling kind of nervous. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m properly prepared for today.\nRose: Well you\u0026rsquo;re in luck because today\u0026rsquo;s episode is all about calming presentation nerves. We all get them. (Phil, we\u0026rsquo;re recording.) So right before we were talking about how to calm presentation nerves. Before we get into some solutions, let\u0026rsquo;s take a stage fright diagnostic. Phil, can I ask you a few questions about how you feel? Is your heart racing? How\u0026rsquo;s your voice? Can you try saying something?\nPhil: It\u0026rsquo;s kind of dry and hard to get it out.\nRose: OK. Are you able to focus? Can you look straight ahead for a moment? Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to keep direct eye contact.\nPhil: I \u0026rsquo;m just too stressed.\nRose: O K, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can find where the issue arose. So, thinking about preparing for your \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; today: did you prepare in a four-part process and think about the ideas and creating the presentation?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you rehearse? Did you try to practice a few times, maybe even five or six times?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you get some sleep last night? Maybe six hours or more?\nPhil: No.\nRose: All right. And\u0026hellip; did you have coffee?\nPhil: Yes. (-Two.)\nRose: Yeah, I know you Phil. OK. So here are a few common traps and things that will absolutely activate your nerves. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that Phil?\nPhil: Well absolutely because to be honest stage fright happens to everybody. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t get stage fright you do get nerves. Now I speak in public all the time but I do get nervous before a major presentation. We all do. It was Mark Twain who said, “the world only has two categories of speakers: the nervous and the liars.” So we all get it, right? The question is, how do we make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t paralyze us and how do we actually channel that nervous energy and give that energy to our audience rather than letting it paralyze us like it did me a few moments ago.\nRose: Absolutely. And that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of where our work comes in as coaches. We work with people all the time to help them relax and get centered, but also just to learn how to prepare well. There is one other thing we didn\u0026rsquo;t touch on and this is sort of a back-pocket, secret weapon towards nerves and that is: the energy or feeling that\u0026rsquo;s running through your body coming out as trembles sometimes, this is fear. But on the other side of fear is excitement. So connecting to your purpose and what is actually exciting you about presenting, this can really help energize you in a positive way. And remember, this isn\u0026rsquo;t your presentation. This is theirs. So get out of yourself. Come back to the preparation. Avoid the coffee if you can. Get some good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prepare.\nPhil: Absolutely. Always focus not on what could go wrong but think about what could go right. Imagine your audience enjoying your presentation, getting your key messages and then achieving your objectives because it\u0026rsquo;s up to them to achieve your objectives for you. So imagine all of that happening. Visualize that happening and it helps a lot. But, you know what I find? It’s that rehearsing your presentation, knowing that that presentation is well-prepared and is going to hit the target with that audience is actually more than half the battle. The rest of it is making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not putting your body in a stressful situation by having coffee, which is wonderful if you want to be productive and creative, but it\u0026rsquo;s not great when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking because not only does it make you speak a lot faster, which actually reduces your credibility, it also dries out your throat and it increases your stress levels. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing that when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting.\nRose: So, three things to remember: one, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Everybody gets presentation nerves, even Phil.

Whatever works for you.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you look at the comments in the thread, it seems other attendees agree with him. The average level of the talks was perceived as unprepared and boring. That\u0026rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is, if you prepare well, you have a good chance to stand out and get noticed. And we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about a small event: we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the CES, one of the biggest shows on the planet.\nWe trained people to speak at CES before, including people who felt they were great and didn\u0026rsquo;t need training. It often shocked them when we told them they were not ready, especially people nobody dared to criticize.\nWe often wonder why people invest so little time in what might be the most important thing after actually having a (good) product: their pitch or presentation. There\u0026rsquo;s no miracle. That guy who was a great showman and seemed so natural? He rehearsed – a lot. He took the time to write a great speech and illustrate it with great visuals. He took the time to rehearse, and was coached by professionals.\nYou may think you\u0026rsquo;re just going to wing it. But that won\u0026rsquo;t fly. If you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready, do this test. Ask the best presenter you know to give you honest, unfiltered feedback on your presentation. If you hesitate to do so, maybe you should ask yourself why.\nAs a post-script, if you are organizing an important event, don’t leave anything to chance. Hire a specialist team of presentation coaches, and make sure every speaker gets help with story, slides and speaking. Some speakers may need less help than others - that’s fine. But a speaker who doesn’t have the time to prepare with a coach isn’t going to prepare properly anyway, and a speaker who feels he is too important to be helped will probably be so full of himself that he won’t adapt to your audience. Neither of these speakers has any place on your stage.\nMake sure your speakers shine – otherwise, the only things people will remember from your event are tweets like Rene’s.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/15/2019-01-14-i-presented-at-ces-and-all-i-got-was-a-bunch-of-ungrateful-tweets/","summary":"","tags":["Presentations","Public Speaking","CES","Coaching"],"title":"I presented at CES and all I got was a bunch of ungrateful tweets"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"By now, you’ve probably heard that Apple was doomed. Last Wednesday they released a profit warning press release, followed by an interview with CEO Tim Cook.\nI’m all too aware of Apple’s previous profit warning. Back in the nineties, after Steve Jobs returned to Apple and a Saudi prince (whose name I forget) bought a lot of Apple shares, I decided that I would be a smart investor and I bought Apple shares too.\nThe ride went well, at least until the implosion of the internet bubble, then things got bumpy. But in 2002, after many quarters of growth, the failure of the Cube and the Mac market failing to gain more traction, Steve Jobs delivered the bad news: a profit warning that sent the price of the stock tumbling. Fed up, I sold my shares. Smart investor, my ass. If I had kept those shares, they would have been worth half a million dollars today.\nBut for us presenters, what is really interesting is the contrast between the communication styles of the two profit warnings. First, Tim Cook’s letter is more than 1300 words. In comparison, Steve’s was fewer than 200 words. It’s much easier to get the key message from 200 words than 1300. Shorter communications are much more effective. In fact, I read Steve’s profit warning very quickly, whereas I had to force myself to read through the entirety of Tim’s letter.\nWhy does this matter? It’s especially important because in such a communication, whether written or delivered during a presentation, the information you want people to pay attention to should be at the end. It follows this structure:\n Acknowledge the elephant in the room. We’re going to miss our financial guidance numbers. It doesn’t have to be long. Just tell them how much, and why. Don’t try to mess around finding pathetic excuses: that just adds more fuel to the rumor fire. Give context. Is it really just an Apple problem? No. The slowdown is affecting all players in the industry. Go in for the kill. Out of all players, Apple is the one that remains by far the most profitable, and looking ahead is in the best position to face the future.  The third point is really the key message, the one you want everybody to remember. If your delivery is too long, a lot of people will only remember the first point. That you are doomed.\nIf you have to deliver bad news in a presentation, this is how you should do it. Be as succinct as possible. Start with the bad news, provide context, then conclude with the key positive message.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/08/2019-01-07-what-presentation-lessons-can-we-learn-from-apples-profit-warning/","summary":"","tags":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"title":"What presentation lessons can we learn from Apple’s profit warning?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Too many presentations aim only to inform, yet this is one thing oral presentations are particularly bad at \u0026ndash; we forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds.\nIf you want people to remember information, give them a document and a coffee, and time to read. Then you can answer their questions, discuss, agree on the next steps, and leave.\nThis is what happens in meetings at companies like Amazon and LinkedIn, where not only do meetings never have slides - they never have presentations. Meetings begin with a period of silence, during which participants read a document that tells them everything they need to know, and the subjects up for discussion in the meeting.\nAfter reading, everybody is literally on the same page. They ask questions, they check understanding, they discuss, they agree - and nobody gets up to present. Meetings take half as long as they did before.

Learn the golden simple question to ask yourself to make your presentation a success. Guest: Phil Waknell\n  Transcript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your regular cup of presentation inspiration.\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at why presentation should rhyme not with Information but with Transformation.\nRose: [00:00:16] So Phil, you said that presentations should rhyme with transformation instead of information. What do you mean by that?\nPhil: [00:00:23] Well, far too many presentations simply aim to inform the audience, to transfer neurons, brain cells, from the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain to the audience\u0026rsquo;s brain. And you know what? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because we don\u0026rsquo;t have perfect memories. Do you have a perfect memory?\nRose: [00:00:40] Unfortunately no.\nPhil: [00:00:41] We forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that try and remember what I said 30 seconds ago. That\u0026rsquo;s really really hard. So if you aim only to inform the audience then you\u0026rsquo;ll fail. If you want to give them information then give them a document, give them a coffee and give them some time so they can read that document. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective but a presentation is fantastic for transforming the audience.\nPhil: [00:01:07] It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic for changing something in what the audience believes, in what they feel and in what they do. So always ask yourself this question when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting: \u0026ldquo;After this presentation the audience will ____.\u0026rdquo; What? What will they believe differently, what will they feel differently, what will they do differently. And that\u0026rsquo;s your objective.\nRose: [00:01:33] I completely agree Phil and what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is that unfortunately I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been trained pretty wrong, even in our schools, when we grow up we\u0026rsquo;re taught to give information first, to value the information. But what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is we don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do that and it\u0026rsquo;s not the most effective place: in a boardroom, in a presentation. And what we can do instead is focus on making a change in what they know, what they believe, what they feel and what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do after the presentation. Is that right?\nPhil: [00:02:07] That\u0026rsquo;s absolutely right. I think the real key point is that the main subject of your presentation is not the information you have to tell them\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s the audience. It\u0026rsquo;s all about them and it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you need to transform them in order to achieve your objectives.\nPhil: [00:02:24] You may need to put some information into that presentation of course, in order to achieve those objectives, but it\u0026rsquo;s all about the transformation. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve got information that does not support your transformational objective then take it out because what you take out will actually reinforce what you leave in.\nRose: [00:02:43] So this reminds me, yesterday when I was coaching this young executive at one of the larger French companies we work with, he is working on his communication style. And when you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to an executive team you know very well you need to be brief. You need to say what needs to be said directly. Well another thing we talked about is in his presentation he will only have 20 minutes to actually motivate his team to take action on a project. This is not the time to inform them of all the bullet points that go into \u0026lsquo;why the project\u0026rsquo;, the action plan, etc. This is the time to motivate them, reassure them, make them feel confident and supported. And I saw the light bulb go on for him yesterday. And I think it can for all of us when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about how we design a presentation.\nPhil: [00:03:33] Absolutely. So always remember if your only aim is information, well cancel your presentation and give them a document and a coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective. But if you actually have an aim of transforming your audience, motivating them like with your client there or making them want to buy something or making them desire something or just making them believe something different: well, that\u0026rsquo;s your objective. Build everything around that.\nPhil: [00:03:58] And remember that what you tell them they\u0026rsquo;ll probably forget, but what they feel and what they get out of it in terms of transformation: that will last. And that\u0026rsquo;s what makes an effective presentation.\nRose: [00:04:15] Phil, now that would be a real revolution. Thank you for watching. We hope we have transformed how you think of presentations.\n[00:04:23] And we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot more to share. So, please subscribe to our YouTube channel or wherever you get your podcasts.

Guest: Phil Waknell","permalink":"/revolution/episode-00001/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Transformation"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Yesterday French President Emmanuel Macron took live, unscripted questions from an audience of 2000 tech entrepreneurs and investors at Station F, the undisputed hub of the French startup community. Ideas on Stage may not be a tech company, but we have helped thousands of start-ups with their pitches, and partner with many accelerators including Ashoka’s ShareIT.io, based at Station F. So we are very much part of the French Tech ecosystem, and very interested in how it is evolving under its new Director, our good friend Kat Borlongan. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t present for the event at Station F, you can catch the playback on Facebook LIVE here.\nIt’s no surprise to see Macron supporting tech entrepreneurs: while Economy Minister a few years back, he was regularly seen at tech events and even CES. But taking live questions, on a day when his government was under fire about the time it is taking over the cabinet reshuffle, was brave to say the least.\nMost politicians would have ensured questions were ‘planted’ in the audience, or simply gathered questions beforehand and addressed them in turn. Macron did neither. Questions were taken from a sea of raised hands by Kat Borlongan, not by Macron, and I know first-hand that those questions were chosen at random.\nI’m not going to comment on the politics or the quality of his answers. (I always try to stay out of politics.) But I will cover three important points that speakers can learn from what Macron did very well, and two more from what he could still improve.\n1. Improvisation requires preparation\nIf Macron was able to listen to unprepared questions and seem completely at ease responding to them – on subjects as varied as diversity, anti-trust, ed-tech, visas and even pesticides – it is because he was extremely well-briefed.\nBirds can ‘wing it’. Presenters cannot. Macron knew when taking this stage that he would have to deal with a wide variety of subjects, and at no stage did he seem lost or short of an answer, plus he did not dodge any question as politicians tend to do. Whether you agree with his policies or not, he is certainly very well-informed.\nImprovisation is hard for anyone (and impossible for some). There is a danger that presenters think that their choice is either to prepare very well, or to improvise and therefore not need to prepare. That is wrong. Macron gave a fine example of how strong preparation makes you ready to improvise.\nPreparation is always the difference between weak and strong communication. Whether you are learning a speech or preparing a Q\u0026amp;A session, Benjamin Franklin’s famous words always apply: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”\n2. Dare to surprise\nOne question received its own round of applause, because it resonated with so many entrepreneurs in the audience. The questioner explained that he finds it difficult to recruit employees because of the very high employers’ social charges, which mean in France that an employee costs far more than they actually take home. “My enemy is the URSSAF,” (the French Social Security agency).\nMacron took a moment to reflect on this statement and the audience’s sympathetic applause, and replied: “The URSSAF is your friend.”\n  It would have been very easy to sympathize, and then to explain what his government is doing to reduce social security charges and government spending, but Macron chose a daring approach. He chose to say the opposite of what most entrepreneurs in the room believed. Immediately the audience had a tweetable, newsworthy statement, and he had everybody’s attention.\nHe then went on to defend the French social model, and the importance of social security, while later saying that they are working to lower social charges and make hiring easier. But that would not have been as powerful without his daring, controversial statement that everybody will easily remember days and weeks later.\nDare to surprise your audience. They will sit up and pay attention – and that is half the battle for any speaker.\n3. Smile, and the audience smiles with you\nOne improvement I have noticed in Macron’s speaking behavior over the years has been his smile. While his predecessor François Hollande strove in vain to appear presidential, and therefore always tried to seem serious and grave, Macron appears to believe in his ideas and policies, and he is now visibly positive when he explains them.\nSmiling is important for two reasons. First, when we smile, the audience can hear it. Our words sound more positive, more engaging, and less boring. Try this on the phone, or try to listen on your next call. You can tell whether your correspondent is smiling.\nThe second reason is that we all have mirror neurons which unconsciously perceive and reproduce the emotions we perceive in others. If you see a speaker who appears negative, demotivated, or even bored, then you will experience the same feelings. If however you see a speaker who is positive, who speaks with passion, who clearly believes what she is saying, then you will feel the same way.\nMacron appeared to enjoy the exchange yesterday. He seemed positive in explaining his policies. That made it so much easier for the audience to feel equally positive.\nSo those are three important lessons any speaker can learn from President Macron’s exchange yesterday. Here are two more speaking tips, which Macron can still improve on, and which we can all benefit from employing more.\n4. Short answers are best\nIn a session where there are potentially hundreds of questions, answering only a handful of them will leave many people disappointed, and many subjects uncovered. This may be easier for the speaker, but it is not better for the audience. While Macron’s initial speech was refreshingly short, his answers to most of the questions were very long. Although he tried to make it up by staying longer than planned and taking four questions at the end when Kat had said there was time for only one, it would have been a far more dynamic, interesting and fruitful exchange if he had taken twice as many questions, and answered each one in half the time.\nWhy? The danger when you give a long answer is that people forget the question, or they forget the beginning of your answer when you get to the end. It is also usually true that much of the audience has no interest in the answer to some questions, therefore it is wise not to take too long unless the answer is of clear interest to everybody. For example, the first question yesterday was about EdTech which is an important niche but a niche nonetheless, and after several minutes, anyone not in that niche was left wondering when Macron would finish and move on to a subject they might care about.\nAim to keep any answer to no more than two minutes. When you set yourself this limit, you will be amazed at what you can say in those two minutes, and it will be more powerful than a comprehensive 5-minute answer.\n5. Finish with a flourish\nMany speakers fail to pay attention to the end of their speech, or the end of their sentences. Yesterday, Macron was able to speak clearly and coherently for minutes on end, but then once he would start to wrap-up his answers, he appeared to run out of words, or out of breath, and tail off. Twice the audience though he had finished, and applauded when in fact he had not properly completed his sentence. On several other occasions, it was clear he was already thinking of the next sentence, and lost power at the end of the current sentence in his haste to begin the next. This is one of the most common problems I encounter when helping speakers.\nSadly this lackluster finish also happened right at the very end of the evening when Macron gave a call to action to the entrepreneurs in the room. This was an excellent way to finish, but unfortunately the last sentence tailed off, and ended up with slightly awkward applause punctuated by a slightly embarrassed “Voilà” from the President.\nThink of a sentence like a two-headed match. It should begin powerfully, like striking the head of a match causing it to burst into flame. Then, keep your message burning, ensuring nobody switches off. And finally, at the end, when a typical match or dull statement would normally sizzle out into silence, suddenly and surprisingly, it reignites in flame!\n(This analogy also goes for any presentation. Start strong, and finish with a flourish.)\nMacron could benefit from practicing conclusions. And any speaker can gain power and credibility by ensuring they finish each sentence – especially the final one – clearly and powerfully. Even when improvising. And if you have prepared well, you will likely have already generated several possible conclusions you can use that will ensure a big round of applause.\nPresident Macron is a powerful, confident communicator. And even though he is already a highly skilled speaker, he is not yet the finished article, and he continues to improve. That in itself should be a lesson to us all: every speaker, no matter how good, has potential to further develop and stretch their skills. It comes through practice, a desire to improve, and through a deep respect for your audience that drives you to give them the best experience possible.\nMacron gave French Tech a great experience yesterday. I have no doubt he’ll be even better next time.\nPhotos © Ideas on Stage 2018\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/10/10/2018-10-10-5-speaking-lessons-from-president-macron/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Lessons","President","French","Macron","Talk","Technique","Tips","Learning","Presenting","Tech","Station F","Paris","Politics",""],"title":"5 Speaking Lessons from President Macron"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s already October and you know what that means\u0026hellip; Firming up plans for next year.

Participants in Vancouver will be treated to high-quality talks from well-prepared speakers, and will leave feeling energized and inspired.\nBack in the office, you and your colleagues will no doubt be subjected to low-quality presentations from poorly-prepared speakers, and you will leave feeling bored and uninspired.\nBusiness presentations are not TED talks. A board meeting is not a stage with a round red carpet. Yet businesses can and should learn a few vital lessons from TED, and apply them to their own presentations.\nWhat makes TED talks different from most business presentations? Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on three key factors.\n**1. Short talks are better **\nOne of the key rules at TED is that no presentation can last more than 18 minutes, no matter who is speaking. Businesses should take note. We always used to ask ourselves the question: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation long enough to tell them everything I want to say?\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact a better question would be: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation short enough to keep their attention and ensure they remember my key messages?\u0026rdquo;\nAttention spans are short, and in an oral presentation people forget most of what they hear within 30 seconds, so the more you say, the less they remember of it. Better to say little, but to say it effectively. Remember the words of Baltasar Gracián: \u0026ldquo;Good things, when short, are twice as good.\u0026rdquo;\n**2. Slides are visual aids, not cheat-sheets or handouts **\nMany TED talks do not use any slides. They are not always necessary, and many business presentations do not need them either. Frankly, any business presentation would be more effective with no slides than with bad, text-heavy slides that actually stop the audience from listening to the speaker. People simply cannot read and listen at the same time, so the more text you put on your slide, the less you are communicating.\nTED speakers do not use slides as their cheat-sheets: slides, where they are used, are visual aids to help the audience to understand and remember their key messages. Business presenters should use them in the same way. If you need a cheat-sheet or notes to remember the flow of your presentation, that\u0026rsquo;s fine: keep it on a card or piece of paper in front of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t project it behind you. If you need to distribute information so your audience has a record of what you said, give them a short standalone document that summarizes your key messages, but don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that your slides will do that job. If they are good visual aids, they will not be a good handout.\nUse slides only where needed, and make sure they follow the 5-second rule: every time you click, the audience should be able to \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; the new content in under 5 seconds. Otherwise they will stop listening to you, and the communication will be broken.\n**3. Preparation is the key to success **\nEvery TED speaker prepares their talk over a period of several months, with the help of professional presentation coaches. At Ideas on Stage, we\u0026rsquo;ve helped many hundreds of TED and TEDx speakers to imagine and create a fascinating talk, to illustrate it with breathtaking visual aids, and to prepare mentally and physically to take the stage and speak convincingly to their audience. Preparation is the key to success.\nFor most business presentations, you won\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of spending months fine-tuning your talk with specialist help. You have limited time and need to spend it wisely. But you can still prepare well, and your audience deserves a well-prepared presentation.\nIf your time is limited, don\u0026rsquo;t waste it all producing slides. Slides are always optional, sometimes nice-to-have, but never necessary - especially if you are anyway giving your audience a short hand-out. Rehearsal, however, is required. If your presentation lasts 18 minutes - and ideally it should not be much longer - then it only takes an hour to rehearse it three times. The fourth time will be far more convincing than the first.\nSo if you have limited time, skip the slides but take an hour to rehearse. It will be time well-spent and your presentation will be far more powerful as a result.\nSummary\nBusiness can learn many lessons from the success of TED, starting with these three:\n Short talks are better: don\u0026rsquo;t say too much, but say it effectively Slides are visual aids: don\u0026rsquo;t use them as cheat-sheets or handouts Preparation is the key to success: take the time to prepare and rehearse  There are many more: for example, your introduction should create an emotional reaction that makes the audience want to listen; and we remember information far better when it\u0026rsquo;s told in the form of a story or example. Those rules are just as applicable in business.\nIf you apply these lessons to your next business presentation, the result might not look like a TED talk, but it will have a much better chance of energizing and inspiring its participants than a poorly-prepared speaker muddling through a bunch of boring bullet-points.\nYour audiences deserve successful presentations, and your business depends on them.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about TEDifying your business presentations, contact us at info@ideasonstage.com or fill in the form below and we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you quickly.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/04/10/2018-04-10-what-business-can-learn-from-ted/","summary":"","tags":["TED","TEDx","Business Presentation","Tips","Presentations","Business"],"title":"What Business Can Learn From TED"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":" Fear doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove the danger.

Losing our cool, forgetting what needs to be said, not convincing the audience enough. Failing in front of our peers. Doubt, doubt and more doubt.\nBut fear is often generated and worsened by inaction. How many of us do not act when faced by our fears? Fear is a mechanism of the mind to forewarn us, an alarm that lets us know that danger lies ahead and we should do something about it before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nThe science behind fear is well-documented. Many of us have heard of the \u0026ldquo;fight or flight\u0026rdquo; instinct. For a speaker, these two extreme actions are manifested by the loss of presence from either shrinking and hiding from an audience (\u0026ldquo;flight\u0026rdquo;) or coming out swinging or trying to control them (\u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo;). The third extreme reaction is to \u0026ldquo;freeze\u0026rdquo; - the presentation equivalent of \u0026ldquo;playing dead\u0026rdquo;.\nThe natural balance where you can make a true connection with an audience comes from confidence and relaxation. Some of us are better equipped to deal with fear, while some of us are not stable enough to manage it well. We can all benefit, though, from reducing unnecessary sources of fear that cause stress we can do without.\nThe following 7 steps may not be a cure for everyone, particularly those with deep fears linked to public speaking, but they are a very good start.\n1. Master your content - don\u0026rsquo;t let it master you.\nThere are often parts of a presentation where the speaker does not entirely master what he or she is talking about. These knowledge gaps can be stressful, and trying to explain something that you have not fully mastered will bring a negative feedback loop from the audience as they struggle to understand. Present only what you master, and master everything you present.\n2. Rehearse aloud in advance with your slides and timer.\nRehearsing aloud is the best thing any speaker can do, but also the rarest. We can spend hours tweaking messages or putting polish on slides, but never enough time on our feet rehearsing. Use a timer so you know exactly how long your presentation takes, and ensure you only take 90% of your allotted time so that on the day you are not stressed about overrunning.\n3. Connect with your audience.\nIf you can meet members of the audience prior to a presentation, this can be hugely beneficial. You must not think like an actor waiting in the wings until the curtain rises. This makes the task harder. Knowing at least some of your audience, and knowing they are not dragons, will reduce your fear and stress.\n4. Check that everything works.\nTechnical problems can disrupt a presentation, but even if it all ends up running smoothly, the fear of technical problems can be very destabilizing for a presenter. Many presentations have sunk due to last minute problems with slides, compatibility issues (software and hardware), fonts not downloaded, resolution issues, not having the right adaptor, etc. Solution? Get there early and take the time to ensure all slides and videos look good in real conditions - on the actual computer and actual screen - and you will save yourself a lot of worry, and reduce your stress levels. You should also find the technician in charge of the room. They are your best friend. I once had a technician who saved me from a crashed and locked computer during a presentation in front of a dozen Chinese fashion executives.\n5. Trust yourself.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t rehearse your presentation 101 times. Trust your subconscious mind and leave a little margin for the unknown. You\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it more.\n6. Avoid coffee.\nThis should be obvious but many speakers don\u0026rsquo;t realize how important it is. Don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee before presenting, especially if you know you are sensitive to it. Caffeine not only increases your stress levels: it also dries out your mouth and throat, so your voice is less resonant and less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ve trained coffee companies and they know this - so should you!\n7. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of being afraid.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m back to the original quotation. If you accept that everyone feels fear when they take the stage, even the greatest speakers, then you can also accept that stress is the body\u0026rsquo;s way of preparing you to perform at your best.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate all stress when presenting, and you would perform worse if you did. These tips will help you to remove unnecessary stress, leaving you with just enough so you can master it, and use it to deliver your best.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/04/09/2018-04-10-7-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-presenting/","summary":"","tags":["Stage fright","Presenting","Fear","Public Speaking"],"title":"7 Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Presenting"},{"author":"Marion Chapsal","contents":"Have you seen Gary Oldman in his interpretation of Churchill in the latest biopic by Joe Wright? If you have not, please go. It’s jaw-dropping. His outstanding performance may very soon win him an Oscar. You will enjoy some of the finest acting and also benefit from precious presentation lessons from the Master Orator.\nHere are 3 takeaways from the movie, which you can immediately apply for your next keynote, sales meeting or investor pitch.\n1.\tSit down and listen.   © Working Title Films—@Working_Title\n  In one scene, likely fictional according to the critics, Churchill decides to go and meet the people.\nHe takes his first-ever ride on a London Underground train, and begins asking random citizens if they would fight the Nazis even if the odds were stacked against them? They reply in one clear, loud and vibrant voice: “Never surrender!”\nThere and then, Churchill’s decision to refuse peace talks with Hitler is strengthened. He rushes to deliver what will become one of his most powerful speeches, taking into account these citizens’ words, quoting them and even crediting them by name.\nI loved this scene and frankly do not care whether it happened or not. In fact, it resembles the coaching advice I recently gave to the Senior Manager of an international company during one of our first sessions. As we explored the context of his annual strategy presentation, using Ideas on Stage methodologies like the ABCs (Audience, Burning Needs, Context), I gently guided him through a series of discovery questions. He soon realized he had only the vaguest sense of his audience: what was their experience? What did they most want and need from him in his speech?\n“Why don’t you learn directly from your people?” I offered. Ask them. Wait. Listen quietly. Put yourself in their shoes. Thank them. And then reflect back.\nSo, during the Christmas holidays, he collected feedback and stories from his teams across Europe. In his talk, delivered before several hundred sales managers, he incorporated several personal stories that made the difference. “Wendy from the UK told me…, Karl from Germany…, etc.” He truly connected with his audience and showed them he cared.\n\u0026ldquo;Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”—Winston Churchill\n2.\tPrepare to sweat. Maybe not blood and tears, but certainly sweat. In this movie, we see once again how Churchill literally perspires over the writing of his speeches. Even to the point of “steaming”. Just like Steve Jobs, Churchill was not a “born speaker”. And we believe no-one is.\nHe drafted his speeches many times over, until the very last moment. He dictated them to a secretary. Perhaps today he would use his iPhone to record himself and save some poor girl’s nerves. He then rehearsed passages, again and again, pacing up and down his room, repeating them aloud, learning whole speeches by heart.\nAs we coach CEOs, start-up entrepreneurs, doctors and TEDx speakers, we are often asked: “How long will the preparation last? How many sessions will it take?” The answer: it all depends on how dedicated you are to the task and its success. How much are you willing to invest in your success? It takes true dedication and involves many hours of lonely drafting, stumbling over words, pausing and rewriting. And then again, iterations with visuals. And rehearsals. Out loud. Again and again.\nIt’s a performance. It involves your whole brain, your whole body. Your full presence. That’s why leaders seek out seasoned presentation coaches for this delicate mental, emotional and physical preparation.\n3.\tEmbrace imperfection and fear. Churchill wasn’t born a master orator—he overcame a childhood lisp by painstakingly practicing enunciation. He also always took his notes with him and would sometimes appear to stumble or hesitate, all in order to make a calculated effect.\nHe knew that a speech which is too perfect, with almost robotic delivery, would put people to sleep. He knew that the more conversational and simple a speech sounded, the more tuned in his audience would be. There is a very touching scene when King George VI asks Churchill if he is afraid. “I am most terribly. Terribly afraid,” admits Churchill.\nDuring our coaching sessions and workshops, we pay attention to vulnerability. We don’t aim at perfection; we aim rather to bring out your authentic best. In the intimate space of trust and acceptance created between the coach and the speaker, fear is invited, politely. And then just as politely, we make sure she keeps quiet. This way we free up the space to hear the voice of passion, care, enthusiasm.\nSpeaking in public doesn’t require you to be fearless. It requires you to speak through the fear.\nCall to Action: Next time you find yourself getting prepared to give a presentation, remember these 3 simple tips from The Darkest Hour and prepare to give your finest talk yet:\n− Be brave enough to listen to your audience—and if you have no idea what they are thinking, feeling, believing or doing, find out!\n− Spend the time to write and craft your messages, and practice them aloud. Then review, edit and iterate.\n− If you feel the shadows of fear—inner critics, voices of comparison, or even shame—begin by acknowledging the feeling. It’s OK: you are human. Then come back to your passion, your purpose for presenting, and move forward.\nDo not attempt to be perfect or fearless. Dare to prepare, and dare to present.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/02/16/2018-02-16-the-darkest-hour-presentation-lessons/","summary":"","tags":["Presentations","Tips"],"title":"3 presentation lessons from The Darkest Hour"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"I am not a naive man. I have reasonable doubts that Santa does not really exist. So instead of writing a letter that I knew he would not answer I thought it was time to refresh the Ideas on Stage Brand, which hasn’t changed since the creation of the company in 2010.\nWe started with the font. We really love Gotham, the masterpiece from Tobias Frere-Jones. Its iconic design is built on a strong lineage of geometric sans serif fonts. It’s been used with great success by Obama’s campaign and on bags of crisps. We think it conveys the image of professionalism and reliability that we carry with us everywhere.\nNext was the logo. The original one drew some of its inspiration from an old Apple app for podcasts. But despite investing a significant number of minutes in its design it was definitely lacking subtlety and refinement. We tried many different ideas, some good, some “interesting”. In the end we decided we wanted to keep a link with our beginnings, and at the same time add subtle clues about who we are. The new logo has three circles. The big orange one represents the presence of the Speaker on stage. The small white circle is the head of the Speaker, the dot on the i of ideas, and the inner circle. The small orange circle breaks with the mold; it’s the outer circle, the one where the Speaker moves forward and connects with the audience.\nAfter working on the font and logo, I still had time to write a letter to Santa. But instead we chose to spend time on refreshing the look of our website, to our new visual identity. We simplified the navigation and made it more visual.\nBy then it was early January and too late to write my letter to Santa. I don’t believe in him but I hope he hasn’t blacklisted me for next year.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/01/26/2018-01-26-new-brand-new-design/","summary":"","tags":["Design","Brand"],"title":"New brand, new design"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"For the third year running, Ideas on Stage was very happy to partner with the TEDx Saclay conference, which took place this November 30, 2017 in the brand-new CentraleSupélec amphitheater at the Plateau de Saclay on the powerful theme of “Serving the Living”.\nTEDx Saclay Keeping standards typically high, this year’s event boasted a rich program of speakers including a few notably prestigious guests such as Cédric Villani \u0026ndash; renowned mathematician and member of the French National Assembly \u0026ndash; as well as artists, scientists, students, entrepreneurs and even a Guinness World Record gamer (Kayane).

From Friday September 29th through Sunday evening on the 1st of October, Marion Chapsal and her co-facilitator Evelyn McKelvie will guide eight willing and ready women on a journey to find \u0026ndash; or fine-tune \u0026ndash; their public voice and take the stage alongside, you guessed it, horses. They call this workshop and retreat \u0026ldquo;The Heroine\u0026rsquo;s Journey\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Evelyn’s June article on “Slaying the Dragon of Fear”, it’s clear that she and Marion share a synergy in their coaching mission even though they come from opposite ends of the pond, as in Canada and France.\nExcuse me? Let me back up. Like Marion, Evelyn is a longtime Leadership Coach, working with Corporate Executives mainly through facilitating retreats. However, she is also the Founder of Equine Coach, an organization which “focuses on leadership development, mindfulness, and enhanced communication skills through working and playing with horses”.\nShe sees how spending hands-on time with horses is a transformational learning opportunity that connects people back to nature and their own intuitive emotional intelligence.\nIn Evelyn’s words: “Whether or not you are a corporate leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, an aspiring politician or activist, or a mom who wants to be a role model for her daughter”, being comfortable speaking with a microphone, being filmed or taking the stage in any way is key to building and flourishing in a career.\nMarion Chapsal, Chief Learning Officer and creator of Women on Stage, is also fully aware of this truth. Why? Because having worked with countless professionals including young female entrepreneurs to global political leaders, her life’s work is dedicated in many ways to nourishing and reinforcing women’s power and presence in their life and work, on or off-stage.\nWhen answering the question “Why women only workshops?” Marion answers:\n  Women really get to speak! They\u0026rsquo;re less likely to be interrupted, and if they are, they will not remain silent as they might when interrupted by a man.\n  Women more easily overcome their self-censorship in a safe environment of their female peers, which enables a sense of trust and transparency.\n  Women have the space to identify specific issues and personal/professional needs.\n  Women develop a collaborative conversation and weave a support network.\n  She goes on to share that “as a result, once we [women] have addressed the psycho-sociological factors and established trust and belonging, with a bit of technique and ongoing practice and growing awareness, every woman can cultivate a voice that’s strong, clear, resonant and effective.” Marion goes deeper on the subject of gender-balanced leadership in her talk at TEDxStuttgart, using the age-old story of Goldilocks in a less traditional way.\nSo, we see there is an important alchemy in [women-only spaces] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-women-only_us_58d04f10e4b07112b64730e4), like The Heroine’s Journey, for their ability to maximize individual transformation through gender-common group intention and action. That said, this newly generated energy and confidence must certainly not stay limited to the space between women.\nLike a roaring fire starts at the level of an ember, tended by a gentle and consistent source of air, female leadership can be sparked among female peers but must grow to illuminate all in a mix of environments and audiences.\nSo how did two women with rather unique coaching backgrounds decide to blend their passion and expertise in a three-day workshop?\n“When I first met Marion early in 2016 we talked for hours about our passions and strengths in the work we do. I knew Marion had a unique and powerful model that helps women cross that threshold and take centre stage with comfort. Our overlapping areas of interest around Presence meant that soon we were planning a joint retreat that exploits the power of our two modalities - being on the stage and being in the round pen.” Words by Evelyn McKelvie.\nI hear there are still a few places left. So, if this calls to you, or makes you think of a friend, manager or colleague who would benefit, you can find details and registration here. And, with TED 2018 in Vancouver coming up, I can just imagine the presentations brewing or in brainstorm phase that would flourish in this type of workshop.\n\"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman.\" - Melinda Gates.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2017/09/04/2017-09-04-taking-female-leadership-by-the-reins/","summary":"","tags":["Women","Events","Retreat","Training","Canada"],"title":"Taking Female Leadership by the Reins"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"It’s a simple fact that most successful startups are run by men. Why? Firstly, there are more men than women who decide - or dare - to start companies. Secondly, men are more successful at raising funds than women, and even those women who do raise funds end up raising less, on average, than their male counterparts. Having spent two years playing in the Silicon Valley arena myself, I’ve seen this truth first hand both in California and now in France. It’s a sad state of affairs, and it needs to change.\nEvents like Be a boss, happening this September 21st in Paris, aim to encourage women to start and run their own companies, and help them to succeed. At Ideas on Stage, we care deeply about redressing the gender balance, ensuring women have every opportunity to build their careers, and helping them to make and take these opportunities with both hands.\nSo, we’re very happy that for the third year running, Phil Waknell, our Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage, has been invited to deliver two keynotes at Be a boss, aiming to inspire the many female entrepreneurs to pitch themselves and their companies brilliantly, and help them to raise funds and attract clients. Given his experience helping literally hundreds of start-ups prepare and deliver powerful pitches that win contests and raise millions, I asked Phil about his thoughts on the matter.\n“Many of the best pitchers I’ve seen are women,” says Phil, who believes that in fact women have many advantages over men when it comes to pitching. “I find women generally spend more time preparing and thinking about what their audience needs, and more time rehearsing, whereas too many men have a tendency to ‘wing it’ and lean on their skills and charisma. That puts women at a great advantage, because preparation is the most important key to pitch success”.\nSo why do women raise funds less often than men? “Partly it’s because the investment community is still very male-dominated,” explains Phil, “and consciously or subconsciously that leads them to invest more easily in men. Plus, it’s a unfortunate fact of life that any minority needs to reach higher standards just to get an even chance, and among startup entrepreneurs women are still a very small minority. This is changing but there’s a long way to go, so women need to pitch at least as well as men, and ideally even better.”\nSo why is it that those women who make it over this barrier and convince investors still end up raising lower amounts than men? “I’ve heard this explained simply: women ask for less capital. Is this because of lower ambitions, lower expectations or lower self-confidence? I think they all play a part.”\nThat said, what does this mean for women looking to raise funds? “Like so much in life, it comes down to skills and attitude,” says Phil. “Learning how to create and deliver a fantastic pitch is vital for any entrepreneur, and building those skills will help women to build their self-confidence. As long as your startup is worth investing in and your business plan is credible, a powerful pitch delivered with a confident, positive attitude and a strong ambition will hook investors. And I truly believe that with this kind of pitch and attitude, a woman has a better chance of standing out than a man.”\nTo see Phil’s keynote and many other great speakers, sign up for Be a boss here - note that the event will be in French.\nIf you can’t make it to Be a boss, or you don’t speak French, why not sign up for our women-only course Women on Stage, led by Marion Chapsal, one of Europe’s leading specialists in gender-balanced leadership and coach to many top female executives.

It is all the more important for the heads of those congregations to be able to speak powerfully, to inspire their followers, and not only keep them coming back but to get them to bring their families and friends.\nTo be blunt, presentation skills are of the utmost importance for preachers, yet they are not always taught how to write or deliver a good sermon.\nThe Diocese of Toulouse, in the south of France, has decided it’s time to invest in their preachers’ presentation skills, so this October, Ideas on Stage will distill all of its expertise in storytelling, oratory and inspiration and take it to Toulouse for a workshop that promises to be very different from our usual sessions with startups, TED speakers and business executives, but just as important and impactful.\nSo, who teaches the preachers? Ideas on Stage, of course!\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2017/08/29/2017-08-29-who-teaches-the-preachers/","summary":"","tags":["France","Training","Story","Preaching"],"title":"Who teaches the Preachers?"},{"author":"","contents":"Ideas on Stage, the global presentation specialists have been coaching TED speakers over the last six years with great results. This year we not only coached but also partnered with TedX McGill which occurred earlier this month.\nThe event theme was paradigm shift and took place at McGill University in Montreal. And as always the speakers were amazing and working on very different fields from gravitational waves to cyborg rights fondation or NGO activist. You can find a biography and works of each and everyone of them here\nBut what is a paradigm shift ? A paradigm shift is when the world conception of something changes completely. Like when people realized that the earth was no longer at the center of the universe, or the Darwinian revolutions. History of science is full of those paradigm shift that are become even more numerous as new discoveries are made. And being part of that shift, helping new ideas come to us is truly amazing.\nThis time it was our coach Joe Ross who did the coaching. And he was highly praised.\n “Joe is a master craftsman when it comes to speech coaching and attention to performance detail. Joe’s highly knowledgeable focus, expertise, and insights were an invaluable asset toward the great success of my TED Talk.” Christopher Emerson\n  “If the talk went well, it was in no small part thanks to you Joe. It was delightful working together, and you used just the right amount of push while respecting what I felt I had to say. I’ve done many talks over the years, yet this was the first time I was mentored, and hesitant though I was, I found it most helpful. Thank you Joe. (Please feel free to quote this—it is all true!!)\u0026quot;. Henry Mintzberg, Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies\n  “I really enjoyed working with Joe Ross in preparing for a TEDx presentation. He was remarkably artful in taking my fixed points of departure — content, background, and worldview — and gently forming it into something that fit the constraints of the TEDx format, and helping pace me in preparing for it in a timely way. But I did not fully appreciate his contribution to the success of the TEDx event until I saw him during the final rehearsals with the full collection of presenters, who represented a very broad sample across subject matter, level of familiarity with public speaking, innate inclination to communicate in that medium, and simple preparedness. The end result came across as an integrated whole, and this had a lot to do with Joe’s coaching on the individual level and his ability to knit it all together.” Dr. David Shoemaker, (scientist who discovered the Gravitational waves)\n As with all TedX events, the videos of the speakers will be available online in a couple of weeks so follow their youtube channel to get more info.\nWe will also be posting those videos on our Youtube channel along with many videos of previous events so do not hesitate to have a look.\n","description":"","permalink":"/project/tedx-mcgill-2016/","summary":"","tags":["TEDx","Events"],"title":"TEDX McGill 2016"},{"author":"","contents":"To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device.

While getting the best possible equipment costs thousands of dollars/euros, we think it’s overkill for most people. There are three key elements you need to pay attention to: ease of access, reliability of the conference and clear audio. In addition, having good video quality is going to look more professional, but you definitely don’t need a high-end cam to achieve good results. Here is a setup that works on Mac and Windows PCs and should deliver a completely satisfactory experience to your viewers:\n A cable or fiber connection (probably the hardest thing to get if you don’t live in the right area), with at least 5Mbps upload speed. Zoom as the videoconferencing software. Good headphones and microphones. Apple Airpods work well and have good microphones, a common weakness of other Bluetooth earbuds. A Logitech c920s webcam.  The step-up: build a semi-pro environment for remote presentations Do you really want to shine and give the best impression during your videoconference? Then it’s time to step up! Each element of the following list will definitely improve the overall quality of your remote presentation.\n A fiber connection is the most reliable option to deliver high-quality video over the internet. This is because when we talk about videoconferencing line speed is just one factor. The other ones are latency and jitter. In that regard fiber optic connections provide a lower latency (the lower the better) and a very stable jitter. Zoom remains our software of choice. Studio headphones. Sony MDR-7506 are sturdy and time-tested headphones used in many professional studios. If you prefer a more discreet look, I like the Shure SE215 IEMs. A large diaphragm condenser microphone. The USB Blue Yeti is a good choice and not too expensive. Be aware, though, that these microphones will pick up any sound and require a quiet room. A Logitech Brio webcam. Although the default colors are not better than the c920s, with proper calibration it can deliver a better image. I also chose that webcam because the field of view can be narrowed or expanded, giving me more options. But the much cheaper c920s is often a better choice because it offers good quality out of the box and is easier to use. Additional lighting, such as a LED light ring. This will improve the lighting in your video. They can be found for a couple dozen euros on a certain online marketplace named after mythical female warriors. A neutral backdrop to hide the clutter.  The next step up is getting a digital mixing console, the appropriate gear to connect to it, soundproof your room, add professional lighting and use a DSLR to capture video. But it’s really overkill for 99% of use cases, and if you are not comfortable operating such equipment during a live presentation it may make things worse, not better.\nProvide Easy Access to Your Videoconference Not being able to access the videoconference because of technical problems is the number one reason why people don’t like videoconferences. Nothing more frustrating than being blocked at the door because of a technical problem. While not foolproof, Zoom is the solution we’ve had more success with, and in our experience has a lower connection failure rate compared to Skype. Why? Because it’s easy to use and guides the user by the hand. Simply clicking on a link gives direct access to the meeting room, and if the software is not installed it offers you to download and install it (with your consent).\n Pro tip: ask your participants to test their audio and video before the meeting. Non-working audio and video are the number one reason why most videoconferences don’t start on time. To do so in Zoom, go to the microphone icon at the bottom left, click on the up arrow next to it, and select “test speaker and microphone.”\n Welcoming Your Participants If people know each other, you can get down to business quickly. Otherwise, make sure that people are ready to start and won’t interrupt the session. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing more annoying for participants than having to redo the intro several times because of late participants or people interrupting because they have a technical problem.\nUsing PowerPoint for Remote Presentations Any presentation software can be used. We’re going to use PowerPoint because it remains the industry standard.\nStart by Sharing your screen in Zoom. The easiest option is to simply share the whole screen. To do so, click on the “Share Screen” button at the bottom of the Zoom window, then select “Desktop 1” or whatever the name is for the whole screen view.\nNext, start the Slide Show in PowerPoint, so participants can see your slides full screen (you may need to click on your presentation again to put the focus on PowerPoint). If you want to use PowerPoint\u0026rsquo;s presenter view and see your notes, you will need two screens, for example a laptop connected to an external monitor or television.\nYou can then start to deliver your presentations in the best conditions possible. Use the left and right arrows to move from one slide to another.\nHighlighting an element on your slide With Zoom and PowerPoint, you actually do not have one, but two different options to do live annotations to your slides.\nFrom PowerPoint: move the mouse to the bottom left corner. A series of icons will show up. Clicking on the pen icon will show a pop-up menu with various options to highlight specific parts of your slide.\nFrom Zoom: in the Zoom floating tools palette, click the “Annotate” pen icon. A second floating palette, the annotation palette, will appear right under the main one, giving you options to annotate part of the screen.\nShould you use the PowerPoint or Zoom annotation tools? Here are the key differences between the two:\n PowerPoint annotations will be automatically cleared when you move from one slide to another. Zoom annotations will remain on the shared screen until you decide to clear them by clicking on the trash icon in the annotation palette. PowerPoint annotations are easier to use for the presenter, because they don’t need to constantly switch the focus back and forth between Zoom and PowerPoint. Zoom annotations can be done by all participants (click on the More button in the Zoom floating palette for more options such as hiding participant annotations or showing the participant names next to the annotations).  How to be an engaging remote presenter If presentations during face-to-face meetings can be boring, bad remote presentations can be insanely boring. Because we have no direct communication with the audience, because we lack the physical presence, because our brain must process the additional workload of using the videoconferencing software properly, it’s easy to sound like a robot reading a bunch of slides. Here is our advice to continue to sound engaging in a remote setting:\nThe most important thing is to keep a natural and energetic tone of voice. Keeping a conversational tone, your tone, is key to delivering a pleasing and engaging presentation online.\n Pro Tip: my setup allows me to listen to my own voice when presenting. The sound of my microphone is fed back into my headphones. A lot of people hate to hear their own voice, but listening to yourself is the only way to be sure of how you sound for your audience.\n It’s harder to detect clues in a virtual conference if participants need a break or want you to slow down. To avoid losing them, don’t speak for too long without interruptions. Include frequent exchanges between participants.\nDon’t forget to put yourself in the participant’s shoes. Add variety to avoid monotony. Divide the presentation in smaller sections. Vary the rhythm and style of each section. What he will see is a video, close to what he would see on television or YouTube. You never see slides full of bullets on either of these media for a good reason: it’s ineffective and boring. Design your presentation so that it looks like a good video with your narration on top. Television avoids small text because it can be hard to read on small screens; we don\u0026rsquo;t recommend to attend a webinar from a smartphone because of the small screen size, but keep in mind that some tablets can have screens as small as 7 inches, so it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a large font for the text.\n We can train your employees deliver great presentations remotely, and we can do it … remotely! We can also help you set up webinars to communicate your message to all your employees across multiple countries.\n Replaying the videoconference One of the advantages of Zoom is that you can record your session. After you finish your session, you can simply give a link to people who were absent so they can watch your presentation. It’s a great way to increase its impact on your organization without having to give it multiple times.\n If you want an edited version of your remote presentation, with a corporate intro and outro, cutting out the unnecessary pauses and hesitations and highlighting the key messages, we can do that for you.\n ","description":"A complete guide on how to deliver great presentations remotely using videoconferencing software.","permalink":"/how-to-deliver-presentations-remotely/","summary":"What you need to deliver great presentations remotely: gear, software, setup, animation.

We will create an online work community whose benefits will have long-lasting positive effects on the productivity and morale of your workforce.\nPropelled into a remote work environment, managers and employees will instinctively try to replicate their traditional work environment. But they soon realize the differences: no face-to-face meetings, no informal talk at the coffee machine, impossibility to check what every employee does every single minute.\nIf these issues are not taken care of immediately, bigger issues will arise quickly: loss of trust between management and employees, uncontrolled suspicions and rumors appearing from seemingly nowhere, a general feeling of frustration with the difficulty to work efficiently as a remote team, loss of motivation and vision.\n Using a traditional office work model in a remote work environment is certain to deliver suboptimal results.\n At Ideas on Stage, our core job is to create connections. We believe that efficient, authentic connections are at the heart of a successful remote work environment. These connections are what differentiates employees working remotely from a true online work community. And we practice what we preach. We have worked as a remote team since our creation ten years ago, both internally and externally with our clients. Based on those years of experience, we have devised a method to help our clients transition from office work to remote work in a few days.\n Online Work Community We will help you build a perennial online work community that will create a sense of belonging and encourage best practices at all levels of your organization, no matter where people work from.\n  Key success factors of office to remote work There are five elements that are critical to the transition from office to remote work:\n Objectives: having a clear objective, a clear purpose is key to keep employees on the right track when no physical office can create a sense of cohesion. A clear vision will give meaning to their work plus will motivate them to work towards achieving that vision. Tools: using the right remote tools, fast and easy, can eliminate the friction of remote work. Trust: for some organizations, this is the most difficult, yet most important success factor: move from a culture of distrust to a culture of trust. Management and employees have to move to a relationship of empowerment to maximize the results and even surpass the productivity of office work. Transparency: ensure that people know what is happening within the company, understand their role in any changes or projects and feel connected. Overcommunication: remote communication is not as natural as direct communication, so talking and exchanging frequently is key to building trust and a healthy, efficient work environment.   Without these key success factors secured, a remote work environment will only create a feeling of insecurity and frustration, resulting in poor productivity from employees.\n From office to remote in ten days Ideas on Stage can help you achieve a near-instantaneous transition from office to remote work because we know what works and doesn\u0026rsquo;t first-hand in our company as well as through our clients. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to achieve a smoothly operating remote work environment:\n Check that you have the necessary tools. Build a clear vision that you will continuously communicate to your employees throughout the entire remote work period. Create a trust-based work environment between employees and management by exemplifying and coaching them on how to maintain a productive remote relationship. Ensure that people communicate kindly, clearly and regularly. Keep focus on resolving project challenges, not interpersonal issues. Organize regular online events to continue nourishing a connected corporate culture; communicate the vision, recognise and reassure employees to foster a feeling of belonging. When possible, plan in-person gatherings or events to look forward to.  How do we do it? Our approach is based on three phases: preparation, takeoff and cruise mode. Provided that your team is willing to move fast, that you have the minimum set of tools to get up to speed and that you are ready to face a few intense days, we can help you transition very quickly.\nPreparation: initial assessment, plan and objectives We start the preparation phase with an initial assessment of your remote work capabilities. We evaluate how comfortable you and your team are with the concept of remote work. Then, we check if your tools will allow you to work properly without creating additional friction.\nFrom the initial assessment, we build a comprehensive plan tailored to your company’s strengths and areas of improvement. Our initial objective is not to provide a full replacement for your traditional work environment, but to give you the minimum capabilities to work efficiently as a remote team.\nWe help you build a clear set of objectives for your team. Alongside clear objectives, a clear purpose is key to keep employees on the right track when no physical office can create a sense of cohesion. A clear project objective will give meaning to their work, plus realistic daily tasks, and will motivate them to work towards achieving said objectives. Just like setting off on a journey, you need to have a map to arrive where you intended. The same goes for setting your work project destination, and doubly so, when working remotely.\nFollowing our initial assessment, we will lead a 90 min. objective setting session using our exclusive methodologies. We will identify clearly defined and measurable near-term actionable goals by first brainstorming the universe of possible desirable outcomes and then sorting them using our Traffic Light methodology to uncover the most crucial actions to achieve and rank in order of mission importance the remainders.\nThis will result in a clear timeline, a project map, which will help employees stay on course during their solo journey, and start to build trust in the remote work environment.\nTakeoff Based on our plan and objectives, we enter the takeoff phase: lift off the ground and get to the cruise altitude efficiently and safely.\nTo ensure that objectives are clear and to build the sense of belonging to the online community, we will start with an online kick-off event, not minimizing the challenges of remote work, but instead giving a very clear vision of how everyone can adapt and that each employee will receive support during this phase.\nDuring the takeoff phase, managers will have daily coaching to address the challenges they may face adapting to remote work. As good remote management is vital to foster a good remote work environment, namely retain key talent, we strongly encourage a personalized coaching approach instead of a one-size-fits-all quick-fix. Based on the number of managers and how large your company is, we could create small coaching groups based on leadership styles to maximise efficiency and initiate internal support connections.\nWe will organize weekly events to strengthen the culture of your online work community. A strong culture will encourage the right mindset across all workers in your company, and will increase engagement and motivation. This could include coaching employees to give mini TED-styled presentations to update the group in an engaging way. Or facilitate group check-ins using heart-based communication techniques developed in California called Council.\nEmployees will be able to attend a series of online webinars:\n How to conduct virtual meetings How to adapt working habits to work remote efficiently and enjoyably How to use good communication etiquette to encourage collaboration and avoid unnecessary conflicts or holdups How to create a trust-based online work culture   Trust Trust is at the heart of an online work community. It is what fosters a positive and productive work environment.\n  Trust is at the heart of an online work community. But how do you build it? By doing what you say you will do. Or at least cleaning things up well if and when you miss the mark. Seems simple, and it is, under specific conditions: when all parties share an understanding of the agreement plus a common idea of what success looks like. Achieving that can be harder than we realise. Communication is king when building trust. SMART goals help achieve clarity and create conditions for success.\nBut, sometimes people don\u0026rsquo;t do what they say they will do. What happens then? We need the right communication skills and practices to effectively move forward from a misunderstanding and ideally let it be a strengthening of relationships and learning for future success. Building trust is about following through, but it’s also about how we deal with things when they go awry and targets don’t get hit. Lastly, it’s not just what we communicate to our team or colleagues but how and when.\nHere are a few examples of activities that we use to build a trust-based online work community:\n Initiation to an online heart-based communication practice (Council) Nonviolent communication techniques, one of the key cultural changes that Satya Nadella introduced under his leadership at Microsoft Implementing regular online meetings with a clear and empowering agenda Conflict or stressful dynamic resolution skills Recognition: make it regular and specific  Finally, if you are missing critical tools to work remotely, we will coordinate with you to find temporary or perennial solutions so that your team is not hindered.

Your document or presentation was received, but will it be read? Will it be remembered? And most importantly, will it be acted upon? Or, did you just waste your time . . .\nEach year companies create millions of presentations and documents. Yet most of them are boring, hard to understand and lack a clear purpose. The information is there, but it doesn’t stick; and so, it is quickly forgotten.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Presentations and documents can be engaging, clear, and to the point. They are not doomed to slowly collect dust in the bottom of the receiver’s inbox. And because your competitors’ presentations are likely to be unappealing, it’s easy to get noticed! How? By combining reason and emotion.\nMaking the receiver hear your message is not enough. You have to catch their interest to make them want to listen. To achieve this, we will first arouse their natural curiosity. Once hooked, we’ll tell a story that speaks to them and their needs, reassures them and makes them want to buy, or act on your message.\nWe rely on a stable team of writers with years of experience delivering storytelling and copywriting for some of the best companies in the world. We can make the most technical subject interesting. In fact, we’ve done just that for a wide range of industries, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetics, finance, and heavy industries.\nTo deliver great stories consistently we use tools exclusive to Ideas on Stage, such as the Audience Transformation Roadmap. This helps us understand your goal, who your audience is and what they need to be persuaded to do. We also use an extensive range of storytelling techniques to keep your audience engaged.\nIdeas on Stage removes the pain from the writing process. We keep you in the loop from beginning to end so you can provide your feedback and be certain that the final copy meets your expectations.\nWe are flexible and are used to working under tight deadlines so don’t hesitate to contact us even for last minute requests!\nContact us using the form below and we’ll start writing your story.\n","description":"Together with our creative business storytellers, craft a narrative to captivate your audience and make your messages stick.","permalink":"/services/communication-consulting/story-copywriting/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Storytelling \u0026 Copywriting"},{"author":"","contents":"Most people use presentations to share information, which is a terrible waste of everybody’s time because we forget most of what we hear very quickly.\nIf you want to share information, give people a written document, and quiet time to read it – and then by all means discuss what you have all read. This is how Amazon runs their meetings, and it works because that’s how human brains work. Meetings that might have taken two hours end up taking 25-30 minutes, even with 10 minutes of quiet reading at the start.\nIt might sound odd for a presentation company to say how presentations are very ineffective – but that’s only half the story. Presentations are poor at information, but excellent at transformation. If you want to change what people believe, feel and do, presentations can be amazingly powerful.\nImagine you are pitching to raise funds for a project or start-up. You tell them everything about your idea – but they refuse to fund you. Did you succeed? No.\nNow imagine you focus on making them feel trusting and confident in you and your team; on making them believe that your idea will work, and that it is a good investment – and on telling them only the few things they need to know to support those beliefs and feelings. Will that give you a better chance of funding? Of course.\nSo don’t inform: transform. Change what they believe, feel and do, and you will achieve your objectives.\nHow can you work out what transformations you need to make, and what to say to achieve them? This is where you can use the Audience Transformation Roadmap™, a simple and powerful tool created by Ideas on Stage, and shared with the world via a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license. You are free to use this non-commercially and share it, as long as you properly attribute it to Ideas on Stage.\n(Non-commercial use means that you can use it yourself to prepare your own presentations, even business presentations; but you can’t sell it as a product or part of a service to your clients.)\nHere’s how it works. You first ask yourself four questions related to the subject of your presentation, filling in the first column with your answers:\n What does my audience know? (and what don’t they know, if it’s important?) What do they believe, or think they know? What do they feel? What do they do?  Make a clear distinction between what they believe and what they feel. Beliefs are things they think or expect to be true; feelings are emotions. For example, they believe it is nearly time for lunch; they feel hungry.\nThen you go back up the right-hand column, answering the questions:\n What would I like them to do after my presentation? What should they feel, to make them want do that? What do they need to believe, so they feel that way and take those actions? What do they need to know afterwards?  By doing this, you will realize that the main transformation you need to create is in the feelings and actions of your audience. This orients your presentation less towards information (which, remember, isn’t what presentations are good for) and more towards generating beliefs, feelings and actions, which is what presentations do best.\nFinally, you then go back down the ‘transformation column’ in the middle, using sticky notes to brainstorm for ideas on what you can say, show and do in your presentation to make these transformations from left (before) to right (after). Later, you can take these sticky notes off the Roadmap, and arrange them into a suitable storyline.\nWe invented this technique, and even we are often amazed at how easy it is to arrange these ideas into a presentation storyline, with hardly anything missing and hardly any superfluous ideas. It truly is a short-cut to a powerful presentation, and we use this technique with our clients and to prepare our own presentations. It’s our most powerful method, and we’re giving it to you to use, so you can join our Business Presentation Revolution and help us to cure the world of boring, ineffective presentations.\nIf you would like the help of an experienced facilitator to help you to run a brainstorming session using the Audience Transformation Roadmap™, the Ideas on Stage team would be happy to help: contact us at info@ideasonstage.com.

Now most of those meetings are online, and they’re no better: in fact, they are even more tiring.\nOur Virtual Meeting Revolution training offers a completely new approach to make everybody more productive, and turn each virtual meeting into a real success.\n A 5-step method for imagining and leading a successful online meeting  1. Foundation  Understand the context, set clear objectives and choose the right participants.\n\t 2. Ideation  Controlled brainstorming to find the right ingredients for your meeting to achieve its objectives.\n\t 3. Creation  Arrange the ingredients in a clear agenda that maximizes attention and interaction.\n\t 4. Illustration  Prepare effective visual aids (slides) and documents to support your online meeting.\n\t 5. Connection  Speak to gain and keep attention, and lead your online meeting professionally.\n\t    What are the 5 flavors of virtual meetings? What are the 4 categories of online meeting objectives? Which 5 types of people should you invite to your meeting – and who should you not invite? How should you use slides effectively in virtual meetings? How should I set up my home office for success in online meetings?  Discover the answers to these questions and many more, and learn how to use our unique Meeting Agenda Planner, in our groundbreaking Virtual Meeting Revolution course.\nOption 1: one day, 100% online How better to demonstrate how to run successful virtual meetings than with a completely virtual course? A whole day online might frighten some people, but we show participants that it is possible to keep people listening attentively all day long, if the meeting is well organized and planned.\nOption 2: Three online modules Some clients prefer to run the course over several short modules instead of a whole day. We therefore also run Virtual Meeting Revolution as three modules, each lasting 90-120 minutes, planned according to your availability.\n Attention \u0026amp; interactivity Keeping attention in online meetings is tough, and it’s the same in online training courses.\nWe used our own 5-step Virtual Meeting Revolution method to imagine and build this course, which consists of several short interactive ”plenary” modules, exercises in sub-groups, individual reading time – and breaks.\nIn this way, time flies, and participants discover not only an end-to-end method and a new approach to online meetings, but also an example of what is possible. This, combined with our highly entertaining trainers, makes sure nobody loses attention in our courses!\nTraining for small groups The Virtual Meeting Revolution course can accept up to 30 participants, with two trainers, or up to 10 participants with one trainer. We use virtual breakout rooms for exercises so participants can learn by doing, not just by listening.\nWe run our courses using Zoom, unless you prefer to use your own standard video meeting technology.\nBig groups? No problem! If you have more than 30 people to train, or you simply want to share the learning as widely as possible in your organization, we can run Virtual Meeting Revolution as a series of interactive webinars. Although participant microphones will mostly be muted in large-group webinars to preserve sound quality, we still make these sessions as interactive and entertaining as possible, using chat and polls for example, and taking participant questions regularly.\nA comprehensive participant workbook Our objective is to ensure participants remember what they learn, and have the tools to put it into practice.\nKnowing well that slides make poor documents and documents make poor slides, we use powerful visual aids during the course, but we don’t simply print or share them because they wouldn’t be very useful months or years later.\nInstead, participants receive a detailed, standalone workbook which will help them during the course, but which is also a practical reference guide they can use and re-use to prepare virtual meetings.\nExperienced trainers As specialists in presentations and organizing major business conferences and events, and with ten years of experience both teaching executives and working remotely with leaders and presenters around the world, Ideas on Stage is ideally positioned to revolutionize not only business presentations but also online meetings. This course and our methodology are based on our real-life experience and best practices from leading companies around the world.\nJoin the Revolution!

Your participants will thank you.\n","description":"What is the best way to deliver an efficient meeting online? What gear do you need?
