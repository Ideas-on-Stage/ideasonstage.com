      <description>A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator. They are entertainers, storytellers, showrunners, but it&amp;rsquo;s only the surface. They will immerse themselves in your event&amp;rsquo;s specific culture and add another dimension with their thought-provoking questions.
We have acted as Master of Ceremonies for numerous events for well-known companies such as Airbus, Microsoft, EDF and Pierre Fabre, as well as industry congresses and charity events, including COP21 and the World Social Forum.</description>
