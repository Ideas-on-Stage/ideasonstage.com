      <description>I am not a naive man. I have reasonable doubts that Santa does not really exist. So instead of writing a letter that I knew he would not answer I thought it was time to refresh the Ideas on Stage Brand, which hasn’t changed since the creation of the company in 2010.&#xA;We started with the font. We really love Gotham, the masterpiece from Tobias Frere-Jones. Its iconic design is built on a strong lineage of geometric sans serif fonts.</description>
