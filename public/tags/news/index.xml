      <description>Recent events have shown that discrimination kills, and it has to stop. Many minorities, not just in America, but everywhere in the world, have to suffer injustice for no other reason than a difference of color, gender or belief. Our position at Ideas on Stage is simple: discrimination, in any form, is not acceptable and must be actively fought.</description>

      <description>Recently I had the chance to do an internship with Ideas on Stage, which has been by far one of my best experiences.&#xA;At first, I didn’t quite know what I had stepped into.

      <description>Ideas on Stage now welcomes you in their Champs Élysées offices. Located in the heart of Paris, they offer the perfect atmosphere to make the best out of your public speaking coaching sessions. And above all, the coffee is very good (although we recommend to avoid it before speaking in public)!&#xA;What a change a few years can make. When we created the company, we rented a space in a shared office.</description>

A: I am Italian, and I studied in Italy and Ireland. I then did an internship in Cambridge, where I fell in love with the UK and decided to stay there.</description>
