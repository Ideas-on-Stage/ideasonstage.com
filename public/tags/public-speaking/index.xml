      <description>For many years, we&#39;ve said that your audience&#39;s attention is like sand in an hourglass. Sooner or later, no matter how entertaining you are, the attention will run out, and it&#39;s not up to them to make an effort to listen: it&#39;s up to you to reset their attention regularly, turning over that hourglass before it runs out.&#xA;Now following successful trials in Switzerland, Ideas on Stage is proud to bring you a completely new and original way to reset their attention: the YODEL Technique&amp;trade;.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Under duress, the body always wins&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Wendy Palmer (taken from her book Intuitive Body)&#xA;In 2013, at a prestigious economic event in northern France, I coached among others, a very successful Indian entrepreneur who has made quite a success in the luxury sustainable hotel industry. He was extremely charming, articulate, and eager to put together a good talk. Working with him was an absolute pleasure and a relatively easy mission for a young coach to get their teeth into because of his positive attitude and availability.</description>

      <description>The best things in life are often the simplest. Some of the best meals I‘ve ever eaten have been simple一just high quality ingredients presented in an uncomplicated way.&#xA;However, it can take a chef many years of training and experience to learn that lesson. The same is true in lots of other areas of life, not least art.&#xA;Look at Pablo Picasso’s famous set of drawing called The Bull from 1945.</description>

      <description>The most likely reason for any setbacks and disappointments in your business, role or career is a communication deficiency—or lack of communication skills.&#xA;If you can’t convey your ideas to others then you won’t be able to reach your true potential.&#xA;The number one factor holding people back in their lives, especially in business, is poor communication skills.&#xA;If your business isn&amp;rsquo;t growing, there’s a communication deficiency.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re finding it hard to lead your team, there’s a communication deficiency.</description>

      <description>When I start working with clients to help them improve their presentations they often push back and resist change.&#xA;I encourage business leaders to use a mix of logic and emotion, tell stories, include audience interactions and use eye contact and gestures.&#xA;A common concern is that the changes I suggest feel ‘fake’ and ‘inauthentic’. People say things like, ‘this is not me’ and ‘I don’t want to act like someone I’m not’.</description>

      <description>One of the worst things you can do when sharing examples, stories or case studies in a business presentation is to make them about yourself一instead of the client or the audience.&#xA;I’ve seen it so many times. I hear phrases like:&#xA;We’ve been the industry leader since 2010&#xA;We have 123 offices in 36 different countries&#xA;We have 7,500 clients across 80 industries We’re a pioneering company in our field</description>

      <description>There’s nothing more boring than a one-way lecture which makes an audience feel like they’re being talked at.&#xA;Unfortunately, too many business leaders deliver presentations which are more like one-sided lectures. They believe their job is to speak for 30 minutes while others listen.&#xA;These kinds of presentations, which don’t consider the needs of the audience, are tedious and unsuccessful.&#xA;How do we do things differently? In this article I’ll explore how to bring the audience into your presentations and make them feel involved.</description>

      <description>One of the hardest lessons to learn in communication is the art of keeping things simple.&#xA;The more we know about something, the easier it is to fall into the trap of making our ideas too complex and too technical.&#xA;It’s something I see business leaders doing all the time before they learn to improve their presentations. They wrongly assume that the audience will understand something just because they do.</description>

      <description>If there’s a common purpose to most business presentations it’s to persuade the audience to act upon your ideas in some way. The best way to persuade the audience to do what you want them to do is with a clear call to action.&#xA;If the call to action isn’t clear enough, the audience will fail to act. Your presentation will have been in vain.&#xA;For example, imagine you were giving a webinar or an introductory workshop on your area of expertise.</description>

      <title>7 Memorable Ways to Open a Presentation (With Examples)</title>

      <description>The first words of a presentation are the most important. Your opening needs to grab the audience’s attention and hold it.&#xA;The philosopher Plato said: “The beginning is the most important part of the work.”&#xA;Sadly, most business leaders don’t think carefully enough about the way they open their presentations. Instead, they focus on the main body of their presentation and leave the opening to chance.&#xA;Or they make the common mistake of opening with a boring agenda slide or by introducing themselves.</description>

      <description>The greatest films, TV shows and novels are the ones with the best storylines. The same is true for presentations. A strong narrative can help you bring your presentation alive and make it memorable and successful. However, most business owners, leaders and professionals don’t pay enough attention to the way they structure their presentations. They fail to develop a clear storyline.&#xA;I’ve come across many presenters who simply improvise their presentation around some slides.</description>

      <description>It’s almost pointless asking if you feel nervous before a presentation. It would be strange if you didn’t. The vast majority of people are afraid of public speaking. It’s perfectly normal to have a fear of public speaking, also known by its technical name of glossophobia.&#xA;Research shows that more than 75 percent of the population has some level of public speaking anxiety. So you’re in good company.&#xA;I’m a presentation coach and I feel nervous all the time before a presentation.</description>

      <description>When you watch the best athletes their movement seems completely natural and effortless. The reason they look so at ease is because of the years of dedicated practice they’ve put in. No one is born with the ability to excel—it requires work.&#xA;The same is true for business presentations. It’s impossible to deliver a great speech without rehearsing it thoroughly. You can spot a presenter who hasn’t rehearsed adequately. The giveaways are that they might:</description>

      <description>There is a famous saying that ‘a little knowledge is a dangerous thing’. It warns against those who know something about a subject but not quite enough.&#xA;We should apply the same caution to those business owners and leaders who pitch their presentations above the audience’s heads. They forget how much they know about a subject and aim too high.&#xA;In Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, one of the best books I’ve ever read, they introduce the concept of the curse of knowledge.</description>

      <description>Right now there&amp;rsquo;s someone in the world having a great idea; their own lightbulb moment which could change the world.&#xA;Many entrepreneurs, business owners and leaders assume that their ideas are the most important thing. They believe that their idea, whether that be a product, service, project or business, is all that matters. They focus on creating and working on their concepts without giving sufficient thought to articulating them.</description>

      <description>When Paul McCartney headlined Glastonbury in 2022 he played a long set which included lots of newer material, plus songs from his solo and Wings albums. Many people loved it. But he was criticised for not giving the audience what they wanted — which was the hits.&#xA;No doubt Sir Paul had his reasons. He doesn’t just want to play Beatles songs all evening. But even someone of his experience and talent can get it wrong sometimes.</description>

      <description>If you truly want to connect with an audience one of the most powerful strategies is to share stories and real life experiences. Facts and figures are hard to remember but we love hearing anecdotes.&#xA;Many business owners, leaders and professionals make the mistake of only sharing information in their presentations. They include abstract concepts, facts and figures. As a result, their presentations remain dry, factual and boring. You don’t want to be a boring presenter.</description>

      <description>Have you ever had this experience: it becomes increasingly obvious to you during a presentation that the structure isn’t clear enough? You’re losing the audience (which might be clients, colleagues, the board, partners or investors).&#xA;If so, you are not alone. Most business leaders and professionals struggle with this.&#xA;Fortunately, there is one simple yet powerful communication technique that will help you: the Rule of Three.&#xA;The Rule of Three Three is the most powerful number in communication.</description>

      <description>Many business owners, leaders and professionals give presentations that are too complex. The consequence is that the audience fails to grasp the message and will not take the desired action.&#xA;I believe that the more you say, the less your audience will remember. So you need to keep your presentations short, simple and to the point.&#xA;Keeping it simple is one of the five key factors behind any powerful presentation. If you are interested in learning more about the others, I have written about them here.</description>

      <description>Most business leaders fail to follow set principles for creating and delivering their presentations. In not doing so they are making a fundamental mistake.&#xA;Some think it’s primarily about creating slides on PowerPoint. They think if they get a decent deck together then they are good to go.&#xA;If you are one of those people who spend most of your preparation time working on PowerPoint slides (or any other presentation tool), you’ve missed the point.</description>

      <description>Many business leaders and professionals wrongly believe that being confident at public speaking comes naturally to some people. Perhaps they are born with confidence?&#xA;Or they think that to become more confident at presenting they simply need to improve their delivery skills and work on things like eye contact, body language and vocal delivery. These things are all important but there is so much more to it.&#xA;As a result, most untrained business leaders don’t feel confident presenting at all.</description>

      <description>A presentation is your opportunity to make a great first impression. It’s a bit like a first date — only the stakes are financial rather than romantic.&#xA;However, too many business leaders fail to consider the cost of delivering a bad presentation.&#xA;Many companies fall into the trap of making an invisible first impression. When presenting an idea for the first time — be it a product, a service or a project — the impression they make is invisible.</description>

      <description>It’s easier than you think to improve your confidence when presenting or public speaking. The more prepared and structured your approach, the more confident you will be.&#xA;Most business leaders don’t follow any sort of organised process when preparing a presentation. Keen to get started, they launch into things and hope for the best. We’ve all seen the person who decides to wing it or who turns up with chaotic notes.</description>

      <title>Why complex presentations don&#39;t work (and what to do instead)</title>

      <description>The most successful messages are the simplest. The best writing gets to the point. The greatest speeches are concise and direct.&#xA;However, too many business leaders fall into the trap of giving presentations which are overly complex and technical. They navigate their audience down side roads and off on tangents. Their visuals mirror this and are often confusing and convoluted.&#xA;Why does this happen? It is all done for the right reasons.</description>

      <description>Think about how technology has evolved over the last 20 years or so. Think about the tools we can use today to communicate our ideas to the world. Now, compare that with the tools we had a few years ago. Today in most industries we have more competition—not only from a business perspective but also from a communication perspective.&#xA;The tools we have today are designed to empower people—lots of people—to share their message with the world.</description>

      <description>Misinformation is the scourge of our time. It confuses and divides us and can do irreparable harm. What can we do to fight it?&#xA;For the majority of us today working in business, life is good. In the last 15 years or so, I have observed huge improvements in the way large companies and corporations respond and communicate with their customers and peers on issues that matter: climate change, DE&amp;amp;I and Digital transformation being the most important.</description>

      <description>Say what you like about Boris Johnson, his style connects with the mob. Our institutional leaders need to put aside their intellectual bias and start figuring out why it’s working.&#xA;Last month in London, Boris Johnson gave a speech at the Confederation of British Industry in South Shields in the North of England. He stumbled, got lost in his notes, and started talking about Peppa Pig. You might start reading this and assume where it’s going.</description>

      <description>Why a 13-year-old speech given by a former US president holds a blueprint solution for our modern problem.&#xA;In 2008, during his campaigning, Barack Obama gave a rallying speech in Wisconsin on the power of words and resistance to hope. “Don’t tell me words don’t matter! I have a dream, just words?! All men are created equal, just words?!” It’s true that speeches don’t solve all problems, but what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again then it doesn’t matter how many policies and plans we have.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, all American movies rely on the same formula; that formula is so sacred that scripts will get rejected if they stray from it. Whether it’s a psychological drama like American Beauty, a sci-fi movie like Star Wars or an action movie like Mission: Impossible, the same structure, plot points and character development techniques are used. I’ll just take one as an example: the hero, the main protagonist, is always an orphan, literally or figuratively, or experienced a personal drama; it is supposed to give the character more likeness.</description>

      <description>Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means “a reason for being.” Ikigai is the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what you can be paid for and what the world needs.&#xA;If you ever want to speak at TED or TEDx event, you should find the ikigai of your presentation. It should be at the intersection of:&#xA;What you love, or in the context of a presentation, what you really care about.</description>

      <description>If you ever talked with me about my favorite TEDx talks, then I am sure I mentioned the late Hans Rösling, one of my all-time favorite TED speakers. On paper, he didn’t really start with an advantage; he spoke English with a strong foreign accent, and his key topic was statistics and demographics, something most of us associate with good sleep, not with great presentations.&#xA;Yet, Hans’ enthusiasm and passion on stage, combined with his unique way to use numbers to tell meaningful stories, meant that his presentations were always a high point of any TED conference.</description>

      <description>Some people think that to make a great TEDx presentation, they should learn their text by heart. Our collective experience as coaches shows that it’s a good solution only IF:&#xA;You like to know your speech word for word and it fits your personal style and you know how to do it properly. If you don’t meet one of these conditions, then it’s best to avoid learning your text by heart.</description>

      <description>Many speakers tend to rush the start of their presentation. During conferences and events, they start to speak even before they put a foot on the stage, talking as they walk towards the center, or as soon as the master of ceremonies stops to speak. It makes them look as if they think they are suffering from the “imposter” syndrome, insecure and unsure that they should be speaking on stage.</description>

      <description>Do animations in a presentation make you feel seasick? Animations in PowerPoint are great, until they aren&amp;rsquo;t. A small dose of animation is fine, but presentations with too many animations can be cumbersome to watch in presenter mode.&#xA;Luckily, PowerPoint offers a simple functionality to disable all animations in one go. In the ribbon, go to the &amp;ldquo;Slide Show&amp;rdquo; tab, then click on &amp;ldquo;Set up Slide Show&amp;rdquo;. Then simply tick the box &amp;ldquo;show without animation&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>As many of us are learning, it’s easy to arrange a virtual meeting, but not so easy to run one successfully. There is quite a steep learning curve.&#xA;One vital area to work on is speaking in virtual meetings. People often complain of video issues, microphone issues, poor vocal expression, monotonous speakers, and poor interactivity. Step 5 of our Virtual Meeting Revolution process is called Connection for a good reason: when speaking in an online meeting, you need to connect with the other participants, and you can’t connect if they are so bored they are not paying attention, or if they gave up trying to understand what you are saying.</description>

      <description>Is there a perfect recipe for a successful presentation? No. Partly it depends on the audience and the context: a boardroom presentation shouldn’t look like a TED talk, even if the subject is the same. And different presentations at the same event – a conference, a demo day, an Executive Committee meeting – should also look different from each other, because otherwise none of them will stand out.&#xA;So if there is no magic formula, are there at least some key ingredients we should always include?</description>

      <description>The lectern is a staple of traditional speeches. We see politicians use them all the time, as well as&amp;hellip; who else? Who, apart from politicians, still uses a lectern?&#xA;If I had to create a 0 to 10 presentation scale where 0 is totally informal and 10 is fully formal, I would say that running naked on stage is 0 and speaking from behind a lectern is 11. Yes, the lectern is really that formal, and in 99% of the cases, that&amp;rsquo;s not a good thing.</description>

      <description>First, a mandatory disclaimer: I like Sixties-Boomer music. If poor musical tastes offend you, don’t read this.&#xA;Last week, I was searching for an old song on YouTube, when suddenly I noticed a video from Joan Baez. I realized that, despite priding myself on my knowledge of 60s music, I never actually listened to one of her songs. So I clicked and listened to it. It was called Diamonds and Rust.</description>

One advice he gave openly to his peers, and to us young consultants, was to get professional public speaking coaching to become better orators.</description>

      <description>What happens when two parties position themselves in a similar manner on the same topic? Simple: the one which is the most credible wins. By “most credible,” I mean “the one that incarnates the rhetoric with the most authenticity.”&#xA;There is a mistake that has been made by many traditional parties. Some traditional parties saw new parties start to gain popularity by advocating extremist views. So they started to adopt a slightly watered down version of these views to attract voters.</description>

      <description>You’ve probably already seen those presenters who climb on stage and rush into their presentation, apparently oblivious to the fact that they have an audience in front of them. Once they’re done, they rush out of the stage, as if you didn’t exist.&#xA;To avoid looking like one of these presenters, try to establish a connection with the audience as soon as possible. Look and smile at them as you enter the stage.</description>

      <description>The days of the expert or reliable narrator are over. We have entered the “Disinformation Age” where fake news, conspiracy stories, and meme warfare rule.&#xA;One of the most prominent casualties, at least from a presentation perspective, is the TED-like style, top down, subject matter expert: the teacher or preacher schooling their passively sitting and listening students.&#xA;We see trust move from the command and control leadership style and morph into something vastly flatter, decentralized/distributed, and perhaps even autonomously self-organizing.</description>

      <description>A funny thing happened when I was describing my “dream job” to a friend. I imagined a company whose mission would be to help people become great presenters, and had a culture that was both supporting and nurturing while remaining professional and attentive to clients’ needs. My friend said: “I know that company!”&#xA;A few weeks later after a relaxing summer vacation between positions, I found myself in the company of all my new colleagues, some whom I met for the very first time, at our annual Fall team meeting.</description>

      <description>It’s your turn to present. You’ve launched your presentation and enter the stage. But how do you know if your presentation remote is working? If you start clicking back and forth between your first and second slide to see if it is working, everyone will notice what you’re doing, and you will not make a great first impression.&#xA;Luckily, someone shared a simple tip on twitter. Just duplicate your first slide.</description>

      <description>Moving with purpose on stage is good. Moving around aimlessly is not. It’s what we call derivative actions, things that we do unconsciously that betray our stress, lack of confidence or lack of preparation. Luckily, it’s very easy to stop parasitic movements, but the solution sounds counterintuitive: use eye contact to &amp;ldquo;anchor&amp;rdquo; yourself on the ground.&#xA;Yes, that’s right. Making eye contact with your audience will stabilise your attention and will prevent your feet from moving you around the stage.</description>

      <description>What is it about designing events that I love so much? Suddenly I think of cookie dough, the small crunchy granules of sugar blended with butter, the heavenly flavour of vanilla extract and the sublime melt of dark chocolate chips. Even before I bake the cookies, the main event in this case, the ingredients themselves have satisfied.&#xA;Designing events are similar because I love what goes into making them delicious–I mean, shine.</description>

      <description>Some adults behave like bad, spoiled kids. They whine, they threaten, they become petty if they don’t get their way. They don’t hesitate to lie, or even worse, use the emotional card to play the victim, make you look bad and make you submit to their will.&#xA;These people are easy to recognize, but very difficult to deal with. Just think of the child rolling on the floor screaming. His parents will look bad whatever they do: scold him, do nothing, leave… they have zero good solutions.</description>

      <description>There is one key objective at the heart of all presenting. Persuading the human mind.&#xA;Today there is a war on for attention and space, with the human mind as object of the conquest. In 2019, emotions rule the stage and calm reasoned logic seems to have gone out of fashion. Individually and collectively, most of us are getting our information from sound bites, news summaries, and short burst headlines provided by our iPhone feed; while opinions change from one glance at the screen to the next.</description>

      <description>One of the most stressful moments when speaking at an event is actually not during your presentation, but the hours before your presentation. To some speakers, the wait can be so stressful that they completely lose their presence. As mother nature didn&amp;rsquo;t give humans an appropriate instinctive response to face the stress of a presentation, they adopt one of the basic survival techniques for protection: they fight the public, they flee, or they &amp;ldquo;play dead&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>You know these presenters who speak for 20 minutes before they finally understand what they are talking about? I had a colleague who was just like that. When I asked him why he couldn’t do a shorter introduction, he said that he felt that all the details he gave in his opening were indispensable to understand the presentation. In other words, he was taking the time to explain the context before talking about his subject.</description>

      <description>Should we move on stage when speaking, to avoid looking static? Or should we stay put on our feet, avoiding any unnecessary movements? Strangely, if we ask different coaches, we&amp;rsquo;re likely to get different answers. I remember meeting several coaches who followed classical theatre training at &amp;ldquo;La Comédie Française&amp;rdquo;, and they would recommend that you don&amp;rsquo;t move on stage when you&amp;rsquo;re speaking. I also remember other coaches telling startup pitchers that they looked like dead trees devoid of any energy because they didn&amp;rsquo;t move enough.</description>

      <description>The communication industry is full of myths that are repeated without any scientific backing. I recently watched this video by a former FBI body language specialist. He used his skills to help bust criminals. The first thing he does (at 1&#39;10&amp;quot;) is bust the myth that crossing your arms is a blocking behavior.&#xA;Bingo. I cannot agree more with this. Most people cross their arms because it&amp;rsquo;s a comfortable position, not because they have a mental block, period.</description>

      <description>I don’t think it’s exaggerated to say that the mentality in public speaking coaching and oratory coaching is fairly conservative. After all, many of the techniques that are taught today were developed by some guys in togas before year one of our calendar!&#xA;But the world has changed a lot since then, and recent technology advances have opened new exciting possibilities for public presentation training. One of these technologies is virtual reality.</description>

Whether it accurately follows the storyline of the books or not is a moot point, because said book hasn’t been written yet. And it shows. I won’t spoil anything, don’t worry.

      <description>“You have to speak slower!”&#xA;This advice is a staple of oratory coaching. But I think it is sometimes given by coaches without thinking about the consequences, and that it can actually do more bad than good. Let me explain why.&#xA;The first reason is simply that not every speaker needs to speak slowly. Speaking slowly is done for several reasons, such as increasing the perceived gravitas (authority) or allowing the public to digest complex information more easily.</description>

      <description>Gizmodo wrote this rather funny piece about Elon Musk’s latest rash of announcements, such as fully autonomous cars and a million robotaxis by 2020. Now, Gizmodo is not exactly known as a staple of great journalism, but sometimes they have a knack to hit the nail on the head. In this case, the fact that for several years Elon Musk repeatedly promised—and failed to deliver—full autonomous driving. Honestly, s eeing how hard it is to achieve full autonomy, and how many problems are left with Tesla’s current autopilot system, it is hard to believe these new promises will actually materialize.</description>

However they are relatively easy to spot, and you don’t have to be a graphic designer to avoid them. Read on and your next slides will look much better!&#xA;Too much content. The goal is not to cover every single inch with content. It’s not because you have some space left at the bottom of the slide that you should put something there.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago someone spoke a name that I hadn’t heard in a long, very long time: Barbara Minto. She’s the author of the Pyramid Principle, a book that was long considered, and sometimes still is, the gold standard of presentation structuring in the consulting industry. But it was back in the eighties. So I’ll dare to ask the question: is the pyramid principle outdated?&#xA;If you’re not familiar with the pyramid principle, it is a method to lay out the information in a presentation in the most efficient way possible, based on how people with little time, especially executives, absorb information.</description>

And in the worst case, such as a meatball sundae, it can actually create something nobody wants.&#xA;The meatball sundae presentation effect can happen at two levels: at the event level, and at the individual presentation level.&#xA;Let’s take Apple’s latest keynote as an example of the meatball sundae effect at the event level.</description>

      <description>It’s a trick I learned when studying how movies and TV shows are written. You don’t do a flash back, you do a flash present. For presentations, that means that you don’t tell the story as something that is over; that makes the audience passive. Instead, you bring the scene from the past into the present, or you bring the audience to the past, and tell it as if it is happening right now.</description>

      <description>The best presentations have three stakes, three reasons &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; they are important:&#xA;The first stake is about you: why is the topic important for you? This is the reason you, and not somebody else, is on stage to deliver the presentation. The second stake is about your audience: why is it important for them? This is the reason why your audience is there to listen to you instead of doing something else.</description>

      <description>“Don’t worry, I’m experienced, I speak at conferences all the time!” How many times have we heard that sentence from speakers who never did a TEDx style talk, yet think that, because of experience, they can just wing it? For us, it’s not reassuring. Quite the opposite, it’s a clear warning sign that the speaker doesn’t really know what is expected of him. Here are five warning signs that give you clues that your speaker may not be ready to give a TEDx style talk.</description>

      <description>If you’re a Startup founder, you’ve heard this all before. “Your elevator pitch should be able to convince anyone in 30 seconds in an elevator”. Hold on hold on hold on! Let’s pause for a few seconds. Imagine that the roles are reversed. You’re in the elevator, lost in your thoughts, minding your own business. There is one other person in it, who you don’t know, and that person is looking intensely at you.</description>

      <description>Last week we saw how presentation vultures can destroy your confidence and ability to present in front of an audience. We saw that the best way to fend them off is to strengthen your vital space anchor. But how can you do that?&#xA;If your presentation has an objective, a clear message, it is much easier to use it as an anchor. Let’s imagine for example that the key message is that your presentation is about a new software service that offers necessary services to protect your IT systems.</description>

      <description>Maybe you feel that your last presentation was a complete failure. You didn’t manage to shake off your nerves. You became confused. The client or your boss criticized you. Maybe you’ve been caught in a downward spiral for some time, each criticism making you lose confidence, and making the next presentation worse. I have good news for you: no matter what your situation is, this vicious circle can be broken, and you gain the necessary confidence to enjoy presenting.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, Ideas on Stage had the privilege of organizing a sales presentation training for Krauthammer at Dolce La Hulpe, close to Brussels in Belgium. For us, delivering a training for dozens of senior people at Krauthammer, one of the world’s most respected sales and management training companies, felt like designing something for Jonathan Ive, Apple’s legendary designer: a bit intimidating but incredibly exciting.&#xA;The training met with great success, and it was fantastic to work with such talented people, but what I will remember most are two presentations.</description>

      <description>I know, paraphrasing the motto of the great Muhammad Ali, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”, doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yet my point is that in a debate it is extremely important to listen and move with a maximum of agility, and talk with a maximum of punch.&#xA;Take the example of the Gilets jaunes controversy in France. The government was completely taken by surprise by the popularity of the movement.</description>

      <description>My colleague Ricardo pointed me to a tweet from Rene Ritchie, who was attending the conferences at CES.&#xA;Dear almost everyone on stage at CES: Pay ungodly amounts of money — anything you have to — to get WWDC speaker training ASAP.&#xA;Or go to Juilliard or the Royal Shakespeare Company for a month. Whatever works for you.&#xA;&amp;mdash; Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) January 8, 2019 This tweet says:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Dear almost everyone on stage at CES: Pay ungodly amounts of money — anything you have to — to get WWDC speaker training ASAP.</description>

      <description>Yesterday French President Emmanuel Macron took live, unscripted questions from an audience of 2000 tech entrepreneurs and investors at Station F, the undisputed hub of the French startup community. Ideas on Stage may not be a tech company, but we have helped thousands of start-ups with their pitches, and partner with many accelerators including Ashoka’s ShareIT.io, based at Station F. So we are very much part of the French Tech ecosystem, and very interested in how it is evolving under its new Director, our good friend Kat Borlongan.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s already October and you know what that means&amp;hellip; Firming up plans for next year. Pitching projects. Assigning budgets. And ultimately getting creative about how to expire old, ineffective systems and implement a smarter and better approach. Look around and catch the shift. It&amp;rsquo;s not time for just another step forward. It&amp;rsquo;s time to leap.&#xA;At Ideas on Stage we coach, train and design for international clients and companies large and small, from CAC 40 enterprises to startups and incubators.</description>

      <description>Fear doesn&amp;rsquo;t remove the danger. Embrace it and get on top of your presentations.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;There is nothing to fear but fear itself&amp;rdquo; - a memorable line from President Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s inaugural address in 1932 at the depths of the Great Depression. At the time he may not have realized it, but his words are among the most powerful pieces of advice for public speaking.&#xA;After all, what we all fear in presentations is succumbing to fear.</description>
