is a competition organized by the “Club des Marketeurs de la Tech” (CMIT) (Tech Marketers’ Club). Since 2016, CMIT puts innovative B2B marketing startups in the spotlight and honors new talents. Each year, the winners are promoted on their website and their media partners. The objective is to give more visibility to the newcomers and highlight their services to their potential marketing clients. This year, three startups were selected: Kiliba, Omnilive and Sensego.\nThe three co-founders of the selected startups took part in the three-minute pitch contest. To shine on stage, they had all been prepared by the coaches of Ideas on Stage.\nKILIBA Kiliba is the first fully autonomous Email Marketing module using Artificial Intelligence. It was created to help marketers who are short of time, stop annoying users who are too solicited by marketing emails and reduce digital pollution by sending fewer emails.\n\u0026ldquo;The Ideas on Stage team was extraordinary! Very professional and available, she helped us structure our presentation to respect the 3 minutes time limit. Then, through a dedicated workshop, we discovered the tricks that professionals use for perfect delivery: tone of voice, choice of words, placement on stage, we worked on everything to be as perfect as possible and convince the jury! The result? We are very proud to have won the “GOLD” trophy! —Amaury de Larauze, cofounder of Kiliba\nOMNILIVE Omnilive is a patented automatic multi-camera video livestream solution. The individual journey of users can be tracked and analyzed to define finer audience analytics.\n\u0026ldquo;The biggest challenge of a presentation is to be short and focus on one message, and only one. The work with Vanessa from Ideas on stage allowed me to isolate the value proposition that best matched the CMIT audience. Talking on stage is an issue for an entrepreneur and although I’m quite comfortable, Frédéric at Ideas on Stage gave me tips that allowed me to really believe in myself.” — Cyril Zajak, cofounder of Omnilive\nSENSEGO Sensego is a predictive marketing solution. The startup helps companies in the tourism sector to claim back the digital relationship with their customers, using IA and smartphone signals to anticipate the moment when they will begin to prepare their holidays.\n\u0026ldquo;The coaching session with Frédéric-Pascal allowed me to understand the importance of putting oneself in the place of his audience, in order to be able to receive my messages at the same time that I send them. I think that this session will allow me not only to become a better presenter and seller, but also a better person. Moreover, it was very pleasant to work with Frédéric-Pascal.” — Teimour Daly, cofounder of Sensego\nIdeas on Stage helps leaders deliver powerful presentations, create inspiring events and empower their organizations with high quality public speaking coaching and training. Get in touch and we will help you create an outstanding event like we did for the MarTech Trophies.\n","description":"Discover how startups were prepared before the MarTech Trophies Ceremony by CMIT.","permalink":"/client-success-stories/martech-trophies-ceremony-by-cmit/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Events","Startups","Pitch"],"title":"MarTech Trophies Ceremony by CMIT"},{"author":"","contents":"How to create a great TEDx event, with Fabien Boutard, curator of TEDx Tours This summer we coached the speakers for TEDx Tours 2019, which took place on June 25 in the historical region of Touraine in France. The event space was none other than the Grand Théâtre de Tours, a beautiful piece of architecture à l’italienne. This region is also home to world-famous sites such as the Clos Lucé, where Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years in France, the charming castles of Amboise, Blois, Chenonceau, Chambord and many more.\nTEDx Tours is so successful it sells out every year. So to learn more about how to make such a successful event, Pierre Morsa sat down with their curator, Fabien Boutard, to discuss the challenges of organizing a TEDx and how to find great speakers. Whether you want to create a TEDx or TED-inspired business event, we hope this sparks some new ideas for you!\nPierre: Fabien, it\u0026rsquo;s the fifth year in a row that you are the TEDx Tours curator. What drives you to organize these events?\nFabien: The story began five years ago in Tours on my couch on a summer night. I was watching a TEDx video and I said to myself: “It’s incredible that in a city with so many medical researchers, universities and so much intellectual potential, there is no way to communicate the results to the general public in a clear and simple way.” I then realized that the TEDx format was in fact perfect to showcase the bright ideas of our region and its inhabitants. It was also a way for me to satisfy my curiosity and find more inspiration.\nPierre: We know that it can be stressful. What advice would you give to other organizers to make things easier?\nFabien: TEDx events are organized by non-profit organizations, by teams entirely made of volunteers. The quality of the team is what really makes the difference. You’re often going to work for one year without knowing what the end result will be. To stay on track, each member has to know why he’s taking part in this adventure, what is his role and why it’s important. Then everything happens in the course of four hours. Months of work get rewarded, and it’s truly a magical moment! The other critical element is the quality of the speakers.\nPierre: Over the past years, you\u0026rsquo;ve found some great speakers that nobody knew. What is your secret?\nFabien: What we do is probably different from other events. We first list the ideas we would like to see on stage, then we find the best speakers we can find for each topic. We try to foresee what will be interesting in 1 year from now, not what is interesting today. With social networks, everything goes in and out of fashion incredibly quickly nowadays. Something that was on everyone’s mind may have become old news three months later; it already happened to us.\nPierre: How important is the preparation?\nFabien: No matter how famous your speaker is, the preparation phase is crucial. You should never compromise on the quality of the preparation. The best speakers spend between 30 and 50 hours writing, illustrating and practicing their talk. That may sound like a lot, but it is what it takes. The first step is to make sure the talk is going to be structured around a clear, key idea. Then there is a fairly long writing phase. Some prefer to write everything, others prefer to write the storyline only. It’s a fine balance between respecting what the speaker wants to say and making sure it’s going to be clear and impactful for the public. The last step is to practice, practice, practice until perfect.\nPierre: What advice would you give to people who want to be invited to give a TEDx talk?\nFabien: Why would your topic be of interest for the TEDx audience? We never select a personality or an ability to speak in public first: we always give more importance to the message that you want to communicate. It’s not necessary to send us a CV; having a message worth spreading is what counts.\nPierre: What do you think is the most important thing on D-Day?\nFabien: What we realized since the first edition, what worked, and sometimes didn’t, is when the audience experiences something greater than the sum of the talks. It then becomes a unique adventure, for the audience, for the speakers and for us. It’s our responsibility to ensure that everyone has a pleasurable and enjoyable evening, that the subtle alchemy between the various elements creates something unique and unforgettable.\nThank you very much, Fabien, for your inspiring tips to organize a great TEDx event!\n","description":"How to create a great TEDx event, with Fabien Boutard, curator of TEDx Tours","permalink":"/public-speaking-coaching/tedx-coaching/events/tedx-tours-2019/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Events","TEDx"],"title":"TEDx Tours 2019"},{"author":"","contents":"About the author Marine Bénard is event coordinator and project manager at Ideas on Stage, a company specializing in presentations and corporate events. Previously, she worked for event agencies and an international exhibition company, and helped organize several high-profile events. She turns business conferences and meetings into dynamic, memorable events, working with organizers and senior management to develop agendas, set up the logistical aspects and prepare speakers that make a lasting impact.\nIdeas on Stage is not an event agency and we are not just coordinators. We are specialists in powerful business presentations and events. We work with clients all over the world to present their ideas and strategies clearly and memorably. We design the event with you every step of the way: advice, reflection that leads to creativity, logistics and set-up.\nAs we do for our training and coaching, we apply our brainstorming, storytelling and design methods to Event Management. This methodology will help us understand together who are your attendees/guests, their needs, the context of this event and your objectives.\nThen, project management steps in. We will organize and control the entire implementation of the various artistic, material, human, regulatory and budgetary elements, and ensure overall consistency, while sticking to the planning. We will ensure that your corporate event is not only memorable for the attendees, but also achieves your goals in alignment with your organizational culture.\nSet the Goals When? Where? Why? What? Who? Answering all of these questions will help you set strategic goals while determining the content of your event. Wanting to organize an event is good. But knowing why, and creating an event with a clear purpose is much better! In any project, foundations are essential. One of the most frequent mistakes is to forget to define the expected framework and objectives. It inevitably leads to oversights and a lower return on investment. To avoid that mistake, start by defining the frame with the 5 W rule:\nWHAT? What type of event do you want to organize? Is it internal or external? Is the atmosphere festive, relaxed, professional?\nWHO? Who is the target?\n=\u0026gt; Employees, prospects, customers, suppliers, investors, press, general public, VIP…? WHY? What is the strategic goal?\nNotoriety, brand image, visibility, team building, loyalty…? Why do you want to organize this event?\nMotivate your employees, develop the corporate culture, make an announcement/inform, launch a new product, educate customers/prospects about a product or service, find new partners, present something new to the press…? What messages do you want to convey to your guests? What will they discover or learn?\nWHERE? Where will it be held?\nConference room, restaurant, office…? What is the chosen geographic area? What type of place are you looking for?\nAtypical, cozy, warm…? WHEN? When should it take place?\nMorning, lunch, afternoon, dinner, evening? How long will it last?\nA few hours, half a day, a day? What day of the week?\nIs the event the fastest, easiest and most relevant way to get your message across to your target audience? What added value can be expected from the organization of this event compared to simply sending a report, a brochure? Ultimately, is this THE solution to achieve the objectives set by your company? These are some of the key questions to ask yourself before you get started.\nUsing the 5 W, you will identify several important elements: the theme of the event, the subjects addressed, the speakers selected, the budget required, the tone of the invitations, the decoration and the scenography, etc. Don’t fall in love with an idea, no matter how extraordinary it may seem. Remember that an event only exists if it meets the expectations of the audience!\nUse S.M.A.R.T. Objectives Specific. They are clear, understandable and as precise as possible, even out of context. Measurable. They are precisely defined and allow you to track your progress and assess the result. Achievable. They must be ambitious enough to represent a challenge and boost motivation and concentration towards their achievement but without discouraging your team from reaching them. Relevant. The objectives of your event must be part of a global business strategy. Ask yourself if your event helps you meet the challenges of your business. And take your resources into consideration (human, financial, material, time); your goal should be consistent with your situation. Time bound. You need to set a date to reach your goals. Do not hesitate to break down a main objective into several steps, which can correspond to given periods (a month for example). The type of event you choose, in line with your objectives, will determine the number of participants you want. The next questions will therefore be about the presence or absence of accompanying persons (spouses, children), whether or not to use facilitators and speakers, and whether or not you want to invite journalists to your event.\nTo choose the date, remember to check the legal school holidays, competing events, public holidays, periods identified as busy depending on the sector of activity, or even the electoral calendar.\nThe location should be easy to reach for your participants. Choosing a location that is too far from any transport infrastructure, too small or too large, is guaranteed to annoy and discourage your visitors. Beyond the content, the location should leave a strong impression on your participants. Either the destination matches a strategic decision of the company (presence of a branch of the company, subcontractors, desire to develop in the region), or you have the freedom to choose. In the latter case, we advise you to select several options as part of a pre-selection and to measure the pros and cons of each of them, before making a final choice.\nThe duration of the event is defined by what you have to say and show. If there are a lot of topics to discuss, do not hesitate to plan your event over several days so that the speakers can present and debate in good conditions.\nFinally, do not choose the theme of your event lightly. The theme will be the unifying thread for your communications and for the promotion of your event. Above all, it allows you to convey the purpose of your event in an original way and ensures that all your guests gather around a common idea.\nOrganize and Set Up Management Tools A keyword: anticipation! Any event is the result of a set of tasks, providers and suppliers, to-do lists, tracking spreadsheets. The link between all: a master organization! To keep everything going as smoothly as possible and to anticipate each action, here are five essential tools.\nRetroplanning You will certainly not be able to remember everything. This document details each step leading to D-Day. It contains all the tasks and sub-tasks necessary for the completion of the project, classified in order of priority. Each task is assigned to one or more managers, with clear deadlines and status (to do, in progress, done, late). You will also have an overview of the people mobilized for a better distribution of the tasks.\nYou are free to choose the tool that suits you best. The larger and more complex the event, the more robust the tracking tool will need to be.\nA Checklist of Things to Have on D-Day This list will be essential on the day of the event. It will be completed one task after another, throughout the organization. This can be for example “Order xx vegetarian meals” or “Don’t put the chairs, tables, etc on stage before 10 a.m.” This list clears your mind and keeps you from constantly asking yourself if you’ve forgotten anything.\nA Technical Timeline The closer you get to the date of the event, the clearer the event will materialize in your mind and you will be able to program everything, minute by minute. This timeline is the equivalent of a film script. It precisely lists every action that needs to be done, when, where and by whom. It is the reference for the day so that the experience is as smooth as possible.\nChoose the tool that suits you best. Excel is a very popular tool for this.\nYour Team Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do. Share your planning with everyone and make a general briefing. Explain to each team member his/her responsibilities to avoid misunderstandings and moments of hesitation on D-Day.\nGeneral Rehearsal Before the big day, imagine yourself in the shoes of your guests. Step by step, experience the event. This will give you the opportunity to compare reality with what is on paper. This is also where you will be able to do technical tests and verify that everything is working according to plan. Ask yourself at each step: “What if?” Considering the worst allows you to eliminate the unexpected and prepare for the best.\nDefine and Manage the Budget The size of your event is largely determined by your budget. How much is your total budget? Is the budget strictly capped or can you plan your event first and then see how much it will cost? How much should you allocate to each element? And what if you exceed it?\nThere are many expense items: venue rental, reception and security staff, caterers, audiovisual equipment, furniture, insurance, etc. It’s up to you to quantify what you can hire for this event. Do you have other sources of funding (grants, sponsors, etc.)? Do you charge your participants? What are the possible sources of external revenue? Should the event be profitable or just balanced? Again, answering these questions will guide you in your management.\nThere’s never enough budget when running an event. That’s why it’s critical to prioritize your objectives and commit only to what is realistic. To stay on track and make sure you allocate your financial resources optimally, here are some tips:\nCreate a first event budget with estimated figures to help you calculate the required budget, income targets, and break-even point of your event. To plan your budget, you can simply create a table and register your expenses and revenues. There are also several specific applications for calculating and managing the budget. Update your estimates with the actual figures as soon as budget items have been confirmed and committed to so that you can rework your budget allocation if needed. Keep a safety margin, essential for unforeseen expenses. Find the right place This is a key success factor for your event. Once you have defined your budget, you have an idea of the number of guests and the kind of venue you can afford. You can then start looking for the best location possible. Here are some criteria to choose THE ideal location for your event.\nRelevance The location of your event contributes to the image you want to convey. The overall atmosphere should reflect your brand image and represent your objectives. Study as many options as possible and carefully weigh the pros and cons of each. The more the place will differ from the atmosphere you want to create, the more you will have to compensate with additional decoration. If all or part of your event is outdoors, consider your alternatives if it starts raining, and choose a date that minimizes the risk of rain.\nProximity and accessibility The location of the place is critical to the success of your event. Make sure that it is easily accessible and that its position is relatively central for your attendees. Check if there are enough parking spots. If your guests are traveling from abroad, then select a location near an airport and take into account accessibility by public transport.\nCapacity The space must be proportionate to the number of expected attendees. Make sure that the space does not appear empty because it’s too big, or that the guests are not able to move because it’s too small. Plan for extra space needed to support the event (i.e. coat room, registration, prep room, etc.)\nOriginality Nothing better to make an impression than selecting an outstanding location. An unusual place will leave a positive image and an unforgettable memory to your guests!\nOnce you shortlist the locations that meet your constraints and expectations, do not hesitate to contact them and ask questions:\nWhat is the price for the rental, including the days/hours of set-up/clean-up? What is the maximum number of guests? What are the terms of cancellation? Is there a caterer referenced/imposed or do you have to plan for it yourself? What are the audiovisual possibilities on the site? What about the power supply? Is it possible to play music? Is parking paid or free? Are there shuttle and taxi services? What can the place provide, and what should you take care of yourself? Is there a cleaning staff? Security staff? Go to the place and make a detailed visit: from the parking to the reception hall and from the event spaces to the sanitary facilities. This visit may give you negotiating arguments before you sign the contract.\nChoose Your Providers Several providers will be required, depending on the configuration and size of your event. Here are some rules for finding the best providers:\nSeek recommendations within your professional circle. This at least gives you evidence of the provider’s quality. Once you find a service provider you are satisfied with, you can start building a long-term relationship with him. Build a database of contacts: company, contact, website, recommendations, details of the offer, prices, availability, etc. Always ask for a quote detailing the costs line by line. You can then simply integrate it and adapt it to your budget. Do not consider any price quote as fixed. To optimize your management, do not hesitate to negotiate with the service provider or put several companies into competition. Make Your Event Unforgettable A great event creates emotion. It pleases, surprises, amazes, makes people laugh… To achieve this, every detail counts: the decoration/layout of the building, the quality of the presentations of your speakers, the animations, the master of ceremony, …\nHow to Properly Prepare the Venue The venue and its decoration can make a huge impression on your guests. It will reflect your company’s image. Whether it’s for a conference, a trade fair, an internal meeting or a product launch, be creative. Create a universe linked to the message and main theme of your event. Internet is a nearly infinite source of ideas and inspiration. The scenography decorators are also at your service to create the atmosphere you want by adapting it to the constraints of the venue. They will help you enhance your brand’s presence.\nIt is advisable to arrange and decorate in priority the spaces that will draw the largest crowd and attention:\nreception desk/entrance buffet the stage, for a conference the booths, at a trade show These spaces will also be the most photographed/filmed. Make sure that photographs will have a convenient location to shoot from. Use colors, lights, sounds and volumes to design an amazing space that looks good on film.\nA successful conference cannot happen without a successful technical execution:\nThe stage is slightly raised so that the whole audience can see the speaker. It will also be large enough for the speaker to move from left to right without constraints, and to accommodate groups if necessary (such as a panel). Arrange for the audience to be in the shade, but not completely in the dark. This allows to film audience reactions if video teams are present. Good stage lighting will greatly improve the chance of having quality photos and videos. Provide a small bottle of room-temperature water on a desk so that the speaker can drink. During formal presentations, the speaker often stands behind a podium. Aside from these very formal cases, we do not recommend its use, as it adds a barrier between the speaker and the audience. Check where the speakers are entering and leaving the stage. In the case of a seated audience, make sure that all guests have a seat. Check all audiovisual equipment (screen, slide format, secondary video screens, timer, microphones, clicker with batteries, sound systems, connection cables to connect the computer to the projection system, etc.). How to select the speakers Speakers will also be a very important and meaningful way to make an impression. In many ways, your speakers, especially big name speakers, will be the “face” of the event and help you attract guests.\nChoose speakers who match your vision of the event and enrich the conversation. They can be opinion leaders who will attract participants, experts who master the subject or theme perfectly and will improve the quality of the debate, or enthusiasts who will offer an alternative vision to participants.\nDo not forget your professional network when looking for these speakers. Searching into your network has the advantage of providing a warmer introduction to a potential contact. It can also help reduce costs if they agree to join your event for free.\nHow to Choose Activities Organizing an unforgettable event undoubtedly means fun activities that will engage your guests and make them have a good time. This has several advantages:\nImpress your guests Create a friendly environment Promote exchanges between participants Attract people Generate posts on social networks During a business event, whatever the objectives, you will have to think about activities that will make your guests comfortable, immerse them in a relaxing atmosphere where they can have fun while receiving the message you want to communicate.\nParticipatory games or group games, such as games using LEGO, are excellent animations for the purpose of a challenge. High-tech events are very trendy and offer immersive and fun experiences. The unusual entertainment offers your guests the opportunity to do an activity that they would never have been able to do elsewhere. In any case, we can help you find the best ideas to animate your event.\nCreate an Effective Communication Plan Everything is organized. Now you just have to start the communication and make your guests want to register! No successful event can exist without successful communication.\nIf time permits, plan for “multi-channel” communication. This maximizes your chances of reaching your target. The better you know your intended audience, the better you will be able to communicate effectively. This will allow you to adapt the tone and style you use to “speak” to your target.\nCommunicate Before the Event Website. Today, an event should have a website. Depending on the time and budget you have, there may be a question of a dedicated site with a specific domain name, a page on your existing corporate site, or a simple banner at the top of your site. Make your site attractive and clearly state the place, date and theme. Do not forget to integrate a button for the registration of your participants. If speakers are present at your event, give them a good place, with photo, text and biographies.\nLanding page. It’s the page that a visitor lands on after clicking on an advertisement or a call-to-action button on your website or social media. It allows you to highlight the most important information, notify participants of the various news related to your event or to send a reminder to those who have not confirmed their registration.\nNewsletter. It is a good way to maintain the relationship with your contacts, by quickly sharing free news and by showcasing new products or services. Qualify your contact database properly.\nInvitations. It’s up to you to choose between paper and electronic formats. Send a “save the date” notice to your guests so that everyone can block the date and organize in advance. Resend an email just before the end of the official registration date. Just before the event, send a new reminder with all the relevant information.\nSocial media. The choice of social media to activate will depend on your target audience. Take into account the specifics of each media. Invent a short, simple and fun hashtag for your event and use it as soon as possible. Send as many tweets as you can. Post your event on Facebook and LinkedIn, add a logo or image and don’t forget to link to your event page. Regardless of the media used, be sure to provide relevant, synthetic and interesting information every time. And entice your audience to share and repost your content to their audience.\nPartnerships \u0026amp; influencers. Some organizations would probably be delighted to help you and associate their name with your event. Try to reach agreements with suppliers who can bring something, either by promoting your event through their channels, or by providing D-Day services or products. Also look for bloggers, YouTube stars, Instagram icons… They are called “influencers.” If they are ready to associate their name with your event, your visibility will be greatly increased.\nPress and media. If you have time and it is suitable to your event, prepare a press release and a press kit to send to a selection of media.\nEvent marketing assets also include teaser emails, mobile event app, designed posters, flyers, pin badges and other accessories to keep the event front-of-mind.\nCommunicate on D-day On D-Day, communication meets a triple objective:\nCreate engagement among your audience. Invite your guests to share your event and its highlights. What could be better than a live broadcast of their messages posted live on the media? Your guests will certainly feel the need to contribute! Give external visibility. You develop your notoriety and at the same time allow all those who could not be present to benefit from the content. Be active on social media platforms, live, via photos, videos and quotes. Create as much content as possible. Share photos, film the event, interview participants and speakers. This content will then be shared on media and on your website. Other elements are also possible to make your event attractive and interactive: quizzes and draws to win prizes; surveys to give a voice to the audience but also collect feedback on your event.\nCreate Engagement People expect more from their conference and event experience than ever before. If a corporate event cannot generate engagement, it will impact the attendees’ ability to retain information. The week before your event is crucial for building this engagement. Here are some simple tips to do so.\nProduce Great Content A memorable event starts with engaging content. The content you deliver should support the strategic objective of your event as well as audience interests and needs. Share behind-the-scene photos, speaker quotes and moments to make attendees really feel like part of the experience. Ensure that your event speakers and presentations are relevant.\nLive posting on social media during your event is an excellent way to keep your attendees engaged. Give attendees the possibility to access the agenda, speakers bios, maps and more to prepare for the event in advance.\nUse Gamification Make your event fun and enjoyable. Add competitions or games to spice up the event. Insert surprises, such as musicians, professional acrobats or magicians. Incorporate virtual or augmented reality into your training session. Organize a raffle and announce the winners in between event sessions. Whatever entertainment element you choose, your attendees will appreciate a fun break in a packed day.\nOrganize a live Question \u0026amp; Answer Session and Polling When it comes to the Q\u0026amp;A sessions, traditional methods are often met with groans and eye rolling. Today’s event technology makes it much easier to interact with your guests. Make use of a dedicated tool to enhance and improve communication. Consider collecting and curating top attendee questions and answers. Collect audience feedback on your event. By listening and interacting, you increase attendee engagement as well as identify opportunities to improve the overall experience.\nCreate Networking Opportunities For many, networking is the primary reason for attending an event. By creating networking opportunities—whether face-to-face or virtual, one-on-one or in groups—you can encourage and facilitate networking and create a more valuable experience for attendees.\nCreate a Meeting Place With Your Partners and Sponsors If you have sponsors and partners for your event, then those paying customers will be looking for real connections with attendees, rather than just signage. They should also have the best seats.\nAdapt the Seating Layouts Conventional seating layouts still work best for some sessions, but there are other options which can improve engagement. Different layouts serve different purposes, so consider the objectives and best approach for each session.\nCreate an Event Hashtag Before your event takes place, create a short and unique hashtag that will be used across your event. Have all your event speakers use of the hashtag. Add the hashtag to speaker slides, event signage, badges, and any place your audience will go for information.\nCreate a Mobile App Mobile apps are now commonplace for organizers and attendees, but remain an effective way to improve audience engagement. A well-designed event app enables attendees to plan their itinerary at the event, receive alerts for essential information, connect with other attendees, and find answers to common questions.\nConference engagement is a challenge but is not impossible. Using the right event technology tools, implementing feedback strategies, reconciling goals and expectations, and staying authentic should be the top priorities.\nPrepare and Print Event Materials What is the key to successful event materials? It needs to be professional, easily recognizable and brand consistent. When you use the same logos, fonts, colors … over and over again, customers easily recognize your brand and easily remember your business. Here are 5 key points to organize and create successful event materials:\nList every promotional material you will need for your event. It’s easy to think about some key items like business cards and brochures, but don’t forget the little items such as signs, name badges, goodies, or the pre-event material as well (invitations and “save the date”).\nDetermine the size of each item. For each item, write down the dimensions required and make sure your designers have the information. Be sure you give them as much detailed information as possible. Your project will avoid delays and frustration.\nUse templates for print materials if possible. Using templates helps to keep your design consistent. Make sure it is accessible to your designers.\nDefine the quantities you need. You will likely bring several different types of materials to your event, but you may not need to bring the same quantity of each. Keep in mind that for some items, such as signs, it may be a good idea to have an extra sign printed up just in case one is damaged or lost in transit.\nCreate a timeline and set deadlines. Your deadlines are going to determine the timeline for the entire project. The first step is to gather all deadlines from your vendors and printers. Then, create a timeline for your team/designers that allows buffer time to absorb inevitable hiccups. Finally, work backward to create your production timeline.\nD-Day After weeks, even months of preparation, the big day has arrived! How to avoid getting lost among the multitude of things to manage that day? How is it possible not to forget anything? How to make sure that everything goes smoothly? Here are the golden rules for perfect execution:\nThe day before, prepare everything you can and prepare for the worst. Scroll through the event planning in your head to review each step and consider all possibilities. A sentence should loop in your head: “What if…?”. This brings to light elements that you could never have anticipated around a meeting table. Install clear signage so that each person can find the site and rooms easily. Review accessibility and safety concerns. Book a significant time slot for rehearsals, set-up, etc. On the day of the event, arrive early! You’ll find time flies twice as fast as usual. Ensure that all technical equipment works properly (microphones, sound system, video projector, camera, computer, connections, lights, wifi if necessary, etc.). Have backup batteries for your electronic devices. All of them. Check that the cleaning has been done. Make sure that the deliveries have arrived (equipment, goodies, documentation, etc.). Print all the documents you will need (detailed briefs for service providers, checklist of “essentials,” technical timeline, flyers, programs, etc.). Build a “logistics kit” with Scotch tape, sheets of paper, pens, markers, cleaning products, trash bags … and everything that might be useful to you, as well as a first aid kit, in case: plaster, bandages, scissors, etc. Brief each team member. If you want to ensure smooth execution, make sure everyone knows from the start what is expected of them. Organize a briefing, in which everything is clearly and precisely indicated. If necessary, provide a copy of the technical timeline of the event with all relevant contacts. Keep with you the documents created throughout the organization. Make sure that the welcoming process for your participants is fluid and efficient. Look everywhere, all the time. Pay attention to the smallest details. Are some buffet trays empty? Did a poster come off? Is a table wobbly? Respect the timing. You are free to designate a “time keeper” among the members of your team who will be responsible for the schedule. Announce the program during the event, and stick to it. Your guests will appreciate having a clear view of the process. Be transparent with your audience or with your teams or service providers. A speaker is late? Do you have a technical problem? Explain it clearly. It is always unpleasant to experience an unforeseen event or to undergo a last-minute modification without understanding what is going on. Be discreet but available. You will be extremely busy, try to be available in case there is a need for you. If it could not be anticipated, accept the unexpected. It’s part of the event … anything can happen. Act professionally whatever happens, rely on your team and control your emotions. And tell yourself that this is one more lesson to learn for the next event! After the Event It’s over, the door just closed behind the last guest. You feel a mixture of relief, pride, fatigue…. But now is not the time to release all the pressure. The hardest part is over but save some energy for the final stretch: the post-event phase. Take time to evaluate and close your event:\nFollow-up. Make sure to pay any outstanding bills and follow-up with reimbursements as needed for staff. If you encountered problems, be sure to follow up with those involved and resolve these issues. Save an electronic record of what you did, so those that plan the event in the future will know what you did, save time, and can learn from your challenges.\nThank. Partners, participants, speakers, service providers, various helpers, … take the time to thank each of them.\nShare. Do not hesitate to send to stakeholders all useful and quality content, such as photos or videos of the event, interviews, … to further extend your event. This can be done by email, via your website or social media. You can also send a report: it’s a good way to receive feedback from your guests if you didn’t already have one.\nAsk. Involve your participants through polls or satisfaction surveys right after the event. Plan closed questions (general appreciation of the event, of the providers, of the program, etc.) and open questions. This will lead to improvement or real positive points.\nEvaluate your providers. Follow up on your collaboration with them, in order to capitalize on the best over the long term.\nAnalyze. Take the time to consider the impact and ROI of your event, in relation to your objectives. It is not because everyone had fun that the event is a success. And the reverse is also true. In particular, calculate the absenteeism rate and assess your budget. Integrate these figures and results into a clear report and share it with everyone involved in organizing your event. Also discuss all the pros and cons of the event place, the different services provided. These are valuable indications for an upcoming event, but also for suppliers and partners.\nAn event represents such an investment, in terms of time and budget, that it would be a shame not to make the most of it. Continue creating content and share it: articles from your video interviews, videos from the film of the event, quotes from your speakers, photos of the event, articles in the press, etc. This will further help increase awareness of your business.\nConclusion Organizing events has no more secrets for you! You now have all the keys to create a quality, memorable and unique event. However, you will understand that preparing for an event requires a lot of involvement and this time can sometimes be difficult to find between the different daily tasks. This is why Ideas on Stage is a major event player who will support you in this organization and relieve your workload.\n","description":"The keys to organize a successful business event.

One of these topics, which is a recurring issue for women, is the Double Bind Theory. The DBT is a complex issue facing women when communicating at work because it conjures a dilemma as they have to choose between displaying likability or competence. Or as they put it in their own words during our session: Am I expected to act all kind of fluffy or act like a bitch? Firstly let’s dig a little in to what the Double Bind Theory means. There are two layers/meanings as far as I am aware. The first meaning is that a Double Bind is a psychological construct that limits people’s capacity to make decisions, therefore restricting their ability to take any kind of action at all. Usually because the decision is a very tough one, or overwhelming. Another way of putting it is a Catch 22 situation where you are paralyzed between a rock and hard place. So, if you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t, you’re in a Double Bind. To give an example: Imagine that you want to end a relationship because the current one is unfulfilling, however the fear of looking for a new one and jumping in to the unknown keeps you stuck. Stuck between dissatisfaction and the unknown, you stay with the status quo and do nothing by choosing what might appear to be the lesser of two evils. A Double Bind.\nThis kind of scenario requires careful thought, and you may do well to bring in feedback from a support network of confidantes and structure a plan of accessible steps to get you down the difficult path of taking a tough decision. It needs a battle plan, not vagueness. The second level of meaning for Double Bind is around communication, particularly in relationships (both personal and professional) and so a Double Bind refers to a set of mixed messages from a superior, caregiver or partner. It comes from the social scientist Gregory Bateson’s theory on schizophrenia being caused by confusing and contradictory messaging from narcissistic/perfectionist parents. So while the parents’ words might be nurturing, if their behaviour is the opposite, the child is in a constant state of confusion. When a child can never get it right, whatever they do, this is very damaging to their development. Let’s imagine a work example: a superior may have given the impression to a subordinate that the deadline wasn’t important, so it gets missed, and then all hell breaks loose because it was missed. Then the guilty party feels like they’ve been led in to a trap or they feel bad because they should have somehow anticipated or read the situation better. The communication was not clear. Whose fault was it? So let’s apply this to the role female leaders feel they are expected to portray at work. There is a pull in one direction for women to appear approachable, non-assertive and empathetic (because this is historically what is expected of them), and the pull in the other extreme when women feel the need to be more assertive to get a significant reaction or a work need met. Either way, the critics’ knives are out: she’s either too soft or too assertive so it’s very hard to walk the tightrope between these traps.\nSo in my view, the problem here is not how a woman should choose to behave but the culture that they inhabit. If the culture is rife with stereotypes and half-baked assumptions about how a woman should behave, particularly when ascending in leadership, then education needs to be brought in to slowly change that culture. I also see the problem of perfectionism projected by some colleagues and superiors that breeds no-win scenarios. If we’re held to impossible standards, no wonder we’re damned if do and damned if we don’t. So the double bind, which spans all relationships for all genders, in all its complexity, seems to be at the root of all confusion and indecision. Whether it’s Catch 22 situations or confusing communication, the solution is complex but involves a re-evaluation of assumptions, relationships, setting of boundaries and calling out bad communication when it arises in order to safeguard our sanity and everyone else’s.\nWe must feel safe in making the decisions that work for us and assume the identity we choose for ourselves. We cannot change other people’s opinions of us, but we can embrace our choices because that is everyone’s right to be one’s own authentic self.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2023/09/04/2023-09-04-getting_to_the_bottom_of_the_double_bind_theory/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Getting to the bottom of the Double Bind Theory"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"\nIn 2012 Rihanna tweeted this simple declaration, and she was right! How can being as solid as a rock help us as speakers? This simple tweet has always inspired me. It’s obviously very boastful but in the years that followed this quote she’s managed to be one of this generation’s most successful and resilient pop artists who still has a great following today. Many others do not last as long. As a performer, artist and businesswoman, she has built an entire brand empire with millions of fans and followers and has given back to the community, raising millions for children’s charities. She has demonstrated that she is as solid as they come. She is originally from the beautiful coral rock of Barbados, a Windward Island in the Caribbean where I have spent many holidays and which is close to my heart. We hear the old adage ‘as solid as a rock’ a lot. Neither brittle as granite nor cold as stone but rather coming from a solid, immovable place. A virtuous place of dependability for our loved ones, friends and colleagues. A place of conviction, love, respect, patience and trust. If we presenters (and above all leaders) could harness this power of being as solid as a rock would we not be unstoppable? Not only for ourselves but also for the people close to us. But how can we achieve this and maintain it while under pressure with fears, doubts, criticism and insecurities that lacerate our power every day? It’s no easy task for certain, but one thing is true: when we become like rock, or a mountain, a grounded force of power, people come to us. It’s attractive.\nHere are fivequalities that make a rock in my view: First Conviction: Finding the meaning that will resonate with your audience of listeners. Why are you giving this talk specifically for them but also for yourself? Can you keep it simple, without the clutter of doubt or of hiding behind complexity? What’s the one word or one idea that you can remember easily that drives the meaning of this talk? Can you distill it into one sentence? Keep it at the forefront of your mind. Next Respect: have you prepared? Have you done the work for yourself and for your mission? Do you have respect for the audience? What needs to be done to achieve this? Practice, review and feedback and then practice again. A good work ethic will garner good vibes and appreciation.\nThen Patience: has the preparation you’ve done been methodical or rushed? On the day itself, when you take the stage, are you taking our time and breathing? Can you show compassion for your audience despite your fears?\nNext is Trust: do you trust yourself during the event? Trust the preparation you have done? Even trust the audience? Trust the pauses and silence that you use. And finally Love: that sounds perhaps a little stretched in this context but I ask you, what powers you? What can you connect to outside of yourself that grounds you? When you take the stage ask yourself: what helps make you a rock? There are practical things that we can do to improve our grounding, particularly if we don’t feel grounded. The most important thing is stance. Planting the feet firmly and leaning into the balls of the feet. Keeping the legs buoyant. The wall exercise, which is an exercise that I work with a lot, helps to ground my speakers. But simply placing your hand on a solid object beside you, while on stage, such as a podium or a table, can give you extra grounding during your talks. Thomas Jefferson once said: “In matters of principle, stand like a rock.” Not always an easy task and even he struggled with this. But all leaders need to understand this and some have proved it beautifully throughout history. We are seeing too many world leaders who only have their ambition guiding them: that is why the message is rarely consistent. Ambition alone has no guiding star. This will not make you a rock. Only conviction, respect, patience, trust and love.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2023/08/29/2023-08-29-im_so_solid_as_a_rock_they_just_cant_stop_me_now/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"“I'm so solid as a rock, they just can't stop me now!” - Rihanna"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"\nBusiness owners, leaders and their teams looking to become more credible, confident and convincing presenters now have a powerful resource at their disposal: Confident Presenter: Inspire Your Audience, Increase Your Influence, Make an Impact by my colleague, Andrea Pacini who has worked hard to produce an accessible and hands on read to help boost that confidence level for entrepreneurs, team players and leaders.\u0026nbsp;\nConfidence in presenting is not just a matter of innate talent or delivery skills.

The event featured the esteemed guest speaker, Dr. John Medina, renowned author of the New York Times bestseller Brain Rules. In this article, I highlight the key takeaways from Dr. Medina\u0026rsquo;s thought-provoking presentation.\nWhy it Matters\nAttempting to be an effective communicator without understanding how our brain processes information is like shooting an arrow without a target. While you may hit something, you won\u0026rsquo;t achieve the objective of engaging and influencing your audience.\nNarratives and Storytelling\nAt the core of Dr. Medina\u0026rsquo;s presentation was the exploration of the science behind communication and how our brain processes information. During the first part of his presentation, Dr. Medina highlighted the immense power of narratives and storytelling. He stressed that if you want to make something memorable, turn it into a narrative. Stories make facts 7-10 times more retrievable on average. By incorporating Theory of Mind, which helps us put ourselves in the audience’s shoes, narratives become a compelling force. Dr. Medina emphasised the importance of making the narrative about the audience.\nWhat Makes Information Interesting\nThe second part of Dr. Medina\u0026rsquo;s presentation focused on what makes information interesting to our brains. He introduced the concept of the brain\u0026rsquo;s filtering system, which selects and deselects irrelevant information. To grab and maintain attention, it’s crucial to highlight the meaning or core concept before diving into details. By following this approach, information becomes more compelling.\nRules for Effective Communication\nDr. Medina concluded his presentation by sharing three essential rules for effective communication. First, insert emotionally-competent stimuli or hooks into your presentations to captivate the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention. Second, pulse these hooks at regular intervals, ideally every 10 minutes, to maintain engagement. For online presentations, consider giving a hook every 5 minutes or so. Finally, turn these hooks into a narrative to make the information sticky. Missed the Event? Watch the Full Recording\nIf you missed the event, you can watch the full recording below and discover the science behind effective communication.\nConclusion\nDr. John Medina\u0026rsquo;s talk \u0026ldquo;Brain Rules for Effective Communication\u0026rdquo; shed light on the fascinating workings of our brain and the importance of understanding how it processes information. By using storytelling, making your narratives about the audience, and including hooks, you can elevate your communication skills and leave a lasting impact on your audience. If you want to become a more confident presenter, take the Confident Presenter Scorecard.

This line from Song of Solomon alludes that to take to the skies, to be carried by the air, comes at a cost. To be able to fly, you have to let go of the things that weigh you down. But the air and wind around us are uncertain, at times calm and at others volatile. However by acknowledging the currents, the patterns, how the air moves and turns, studying it and above all surrendering to it, we may be able to harness it. By reacting to life’s randomness and riding the gust of opportunity when the wind blows our way.\nI would further add, for us land dwellers, flying is impossible. Yet aerodynamics have allowed us to achieve the impossible though ingenuity and design. We have built flying machines that defy gravity. That is why to harness the air we cannot choose to live a low-resistance existence but accept that sometimes, sometimes, we need to try to take flight and try something new. So from all of this, how can we harness the possibility of taking to the air for presenting? Here are 4 concept ideas for Air: Air is about embracing innovation as a presenter. As a speaker, tools to help develop speaking skills are important. Whether it’s the tools we need to create a great story, practice effectively in optimum conditions or design powerful visuals, what the concept of air inspires is theory and technology to excel. Like aerodynamics harnessed by a flying machine, we need to study and learn the science of communication and speaking. If we don’t understand storytelling, design principles and how to work an audience, how can we succeed? So we need to learn. Work with a teacher, master the craft of sequencing a story, understand the three axes of a powerful argument, how to find the right energy balance when connecting to a crowd of strangers, mastering technology tools when creating visuals and also accepting and experimenting with the newer technologies that come with the new hybrid media that we are all obliged to use today. Air is about making decisions and seeking simplicity. Simplicity and brevity are two important virtues for presenters. We must seek to simplify in order to help our audiences and make decisions on what they need to know and forget the rest. So that’s empathy, reflection and cutting stuff out! If we are lighter we fly better.\nAir is flexible: it fills voids and connects the dots. When we speak, story and ideas need to breathe. How can we recognize the creative mental flow of our ideas? Like air, our ideas flow from our mind and should be given the freedom to come and go, especially in improvisation. Air is letting go: this is a familiar theme in the elements but letting go as presenters is extremely important. As it is in life.\nAir is our fuel as speakers. Without air we cannot live, think or speak. Our breath and the correct management of that breath are primordial for our success as speakers. When we train ourselves we must harness our breathing apparatus, understand it and use it to its maximum. Without breath we have no power, no energy and no authority. Air is life. Air is power. There are many powerful ideas here related to air. Ultimately, as with all of the elements, we must realize the philosophy of surrendering to currents, letting go of outcomes but also facing resistance when necessary by being clear about what we want and pursuing our objectives. All the four elements teach us this.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2023/04/03/2023-04-03-if_you_surrendered_to_the_air_you_could_ride_it/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":"\nThe latest innovation from Ideas on Stage that will revolutionise the world of public speaking!\nAs I was writing my upcoming book, \u0026ldquo;Confident Presenter”, our team at Ideas on Stage started working on a super exciting project that will complement the book.\nIt’s a hypnosis tape that can instantly turn anyone into a confident presenter.

He was a master wordsmith of wit and observation. He wrote some of the English languages most famous stories and plays including the Importance of Being Earnest and A picture of Dorian Gray. In this particular quote from Lord Henry Wooton, a character from Dorian Gray: “What fire doesn’t destroy it hardens” it is referring to the strong “character” of another female protagonist. “She has not feet of clay but rather feet of porcelain and they have been through fire.” The flames of experience are truly what will make us grow and there is no faster way to growth than through pain, providing that we have sufficient grounding. As presenters, we truly evolve, develop and grow only by putting ourselves in the ring (or rather on stage) when we are strong and prepared, with a genuine desire to challenge ourselves.\nHere are 3 thoughts I have around flames and presenting:\nFire hardens through experience: Take measured steps to grow. You shouldn’t be throwing yourself into the deep end too harshly. This can do more harm than good, especially if it leads to a traumatic experience. But keep challenging yourself. In different situations, with different technologies. With slides, without slides, small audiences, big audiences. Different levels of formality. Learn to say yes rather than no. Step outside of your comfort zone, gain in confidence through trial and error. Step tentatively into the flames. Challenge yourself! Fire is the element of conversion and transformation. Fire warms and illuminates: The warm nature of fire brings us closer to our audience with comfort and good humor. There have been some wonderful speakers whose warmth has been infectious. A speaker like Brené Brown has warmth, with passion but also compassion in it. Fire also illuminates the way for our ideas. Connect your content to your heart, rehearse and work to stay present in the moment while presenting. Get a feel for your audience’s reactions. We can also warm with our voice by varying our tone, phrasing and tempo. This is particularly important for online presenting. Fire is inclusive. It unifies us: The sunny quality of fire unites the crowd. If they see a passionate, joyful and radiant speaker they will drop their guard. Like a great stand-up comic, it encourages group dynamics. The big secret here is to take a little risk and try to improvise. Adapt to the moment, like water. Fire and water are connected in this regard. I’d like to finish on this quote by Carl Jung:\n“The difference between a good life and a bad life is how well you walk through the fire.”\nFire awaits us all. We will all be inevitably tested at some point, the question is how can we be prepared, grounded and resilient enough to emerge stronger from the trials. That doesn’t mean that we have to get burned to evolve, but we have to challenge ourselves regularly, with a positive mindset.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2023/01/09/2023-01-09-oscar_wilde_what_fire_does_not_destroy_it_hardens/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Oscar Wilde: “What fire does not destroy, it hardens”"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":"\nIdeas don’t sell themselves. If you want to persuade others to act on your ideas, you need to be an effective communicator. We’ve recently hosted a special masterclass with the one and only Carmine Gallo as a guest speaker. Carmine Gallo is a communication coach for the world’s most admired brands. He’s a Harvard instructor, leadership advisor, and bestselling author whose books have been translated into more than 40 languages. The focus of the masterclass was on his latest book, The Bezos Blueprint – Communication Secrets That Power Amazon’s Success.\n​​The book includes unique insights that will help anyone improve their communication skills. Gallo examined more than two decades of Bezos’ letters to shareholders to reveal the communication strategies behind Amazon’s success.\nIn the masterclass Carmine Gallo explained that great communicators have three qualities. They are storytellers, simplifiers and mission keepers. At a high-level, here are some concepts that Gallo explained: Storytellers\nStorytelling is a competitive advantage for leaders The neuroscience of storytelling: when a speaker tells a story, the brain of the speaker and that of the listener are in sync The difference between a story and a good story The structure of good stories How entrepreneurs can tell their origin story Simplifiers Simple is the new superpower. The ability to take complex information and make it simple to understand is key Short words are best and old words when short are best of all. For example, “Turn off the lights when you leave the house” is better than “Upon departing the premises, please reduce the illumination in the abode.” Use short words to talk about hard things The more complex your concept, the simpler the language should be Use language that 13-15 year olds can understand One way to simplify your message is to follow the rule of three Mission keepers As a business leader, having an idea about what your mission is isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. You also need to be the keeper of that mission.\nFor example, Amazon’s mission is to be ‘Earth’s most customer-centric company’. Jeff Bezos has always been the keeper of that mission. He was the repeater in chief. He shared the same message (‘Our mission is to be Earth’s most customer-centric company’) over and over from day one. If you’d like to learn more about the three qualities great communicators have, here’s the recording.

Some of the best meals I‘ve ever eaten have been simple一just high quality ingredients presented in an uncomplicated way.\nHowever, it can take a chef many years of training and experience to learn that lesson. The same is true in lots of other areas of life, not least art.\nLook at Pablo Picasso’s famous set of drawing called The Bull from 1945.\nThe way to view this work of art is one row at a time from left to right, moving top to bottom.\nPicasso started with a realistic bull (first image, top left). Then he went through a series of iterations, removing details each time. The final sketch is beautiful in its simplicity. Picasso strips away everything but a few simple lines to represent what is unquestionably a bull. It’s a bull in its most pure form, drawn by a visual genius.\nPicasso has removed the unnecessary. Less is more. Randy Nelson, a former Dean of Pixar University and member of the Faculty of Apple University, used this example as part of an internal course called Communicating at Apple.\nMinimalism is integral to Apple products and its whole corporate philosophy. They always try to capture the essence of an idea in products which are as simple and intuitive as possible. When Steve Jobs presented Apple’s new remote control in 2005, he showed that all the standard remote controls available at the time had more than 40 buttons.\nApple created a remote control with just six buttons: to go back and forth, turn the volume up or down, play or pause and select the menu. That\u0026rsquo;s it. It’s simplicity put into practice. Removing the unnecessary. Like Picasso, they also went through a series of iterations and at every iteration kept removing buttons … to a point where only the essential ones were available. So, what does this mean for you? This idea of simplicity is not only important in product design, but also in presentation design. Designing by subtraction is key.\nThe French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said: “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”\nNot only is simplicity in your designs more elegant, it also ensures that your slides don’t compete with what you’re saying verbally.\nPeople can’t read and listen at the same time, so keep your slides simple and visual. One idea per slide is enough, like billboards. Make sure your audience can understand the message behind your slides in no more than three seconds. Your slides should be visual aids that support, reinforce and amplify your message. Remember, you are the presentation, not your slides. What if I have to include more details? Many presenters think that the above advice doesn’t apply to them. They insist that they need to do things their way, for their particular audience (who want to see more details on slides), or for their industry. People tell me they need to have slides which can be displayed during their live presentation and be used as a handout afterwards.\nIf you’re one of those presenters, here’s the solution for you: Separate, separate, separate. Confident presenters separate. What you say during a presentation (your words), what you show (your slides) and what you give (your handout) are three different things which should be separated. Slides and documents are different and should be used for different purposes. Confident presenters always keep their slides simple and visual. If the audience requires more detail, they will have a handout prepared which they can distribute before, during or after the presentation (depending on the context). The handout includes all the information and details, the slides remain simple. Pick the right tools for the job. You don’t need a full set of fancy clubs to play a bit of crazy golf with your kids. You should regard slides and documents as two separate tools for different purposes.\nIn summary, remember these three tips about slide design:\nKeep your slides simple Keep them visual without too much text (think billboards) Reserve handouts for more details What next If you found this article helpful, feel free to share your thoughts using the contact form below. Please share the article with any friends or colleagues who might also benefit from it. If you want to become a more confident presenter, take the Confident Presenter Scorecard.

If you want to make change you need to take action.\nInstead, most people who read articles and watch videos do nothing afterwards. They won’t put the lessons into action. Or they will put off doing anything to improve and procrastinate. Procrastination (the action of delaying or postponing something) is the enemy of improvement. When we procrastinate, we’re in a permanent state of wanting to do things but never actually doing them一passive spectators to the other people who are moving forward.\nWe come across procrastinators all the time. They say things like:\n‘I’d love to start a business but now is not the right time. I’ll wait for the perfect time.’\n‘One day I’d like to travel to Southeast Asia but now is not the right time. I’ll wait for the perfect time.’ ‘I’d love to learn how to play the piano but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit in with my life at the moment. I’ll do it next year.’\n‘I need to improve my presentation skills but it’s not the main priority. I’ll wait until things change.’\nThe truth is, the perfect time will never arrive. There will never be a perfect time. Perfection is an unachievable ideal.\nInstead of focussing on perfection, think about making progress.\nWhen it comes to public speaking in particular, there’s no such thing as a perfect presentation. A good presentation is good enough. My business mentor once asked me to create a brochure for a new product I was launching, so that I could use it during sales conversations with potential clients. It took me months to create one brochure. To me it was never ready because it was never perfect. One day, after months of tweaking and changing and improving, I was so proud of myself I texted him and said, “My brochure is 99 percent done!”. What a great accomplishment, I thought. He replied with one sentence: “99 percent done is not done.” That was a huge lesson for me. Almost done is not done. Done is better than perfect. Now is better than later. If you want to achieve your goals, you need to have a healthy sense of urgency. Most people postpone what could be done today until tomorrow. They procrastinate. They spend more time stressing about their presentations rather than giving them.\nDon’t fall into the trap of standing still when you could be doing something to improve.\nTop entrepreneurs and business leaders are implementers. They take action to move towards their goals. They make sure that what needs to be done, gets done today, not tomorrow. If you’ve ever asked yourself, “when is the right time to start working on my presentation skills?”, the answer is now. Boost your value Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has done alright for himself. He tells business students that the one skill which will boost their value by 50 percent is public speaking.\nAddressing a group of students at Columbia University in 2009 he said: “Right now, I would pay $100,000 for 10 percent of the future earnings of any of you, so if you\u0026rsquo;re interested, see me after class.\u0026quot;\nHaving grabbed their attention he added: “Now, you can improve your value by 50 percent just by learning communication skills—public speaking. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case, see me after class and I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you $150,000.\u0026quot;\nBuffett is a firm believer in the value of public speaking for business leaders. The certificate for the Dale Carnegie public speaking course he took as a young investor still hangs on his office wall.\nMastering the art of public speaking can be rewarding. You’ll be rewarded in your business and your career. But there will be no reward without action.\nGood things don’t come to those who wait. Be the best presenter you can be.

People say things like, ‘this is not me’ and ‘I don’t want to act like someone I’m not’. But it’s a mistake to think that something which doesn’t come naturally is somehow not authentic.\nResisting change and arguing that it’s not authentic is an excuse. When we’re pushed outside our comfort zones it’s a defence mechanism to say that it doesn’t feel ‘authentic’. It’s a way to get ourselves off the hook and to avoid having to do anything which is beyond our normal boundaries.\nHowever, if you want to become a better presenter, there’s no other way to do it. Positive change requires us to step outside our safe zone一and that\u0026rsquo;s hard to do.\nIn this article I’m going to explain why you need to stop worrying about being authentic一and why implementing changes is authentic if you have the right underlying motives.\nDon’t use authenticity as an excuse There are many times in our day-to-day lives where we wouldn’t choose to be authentic.\nThankfully, we’ve evolved to eat with forks and use toilets, neither of which we used to do if we go far enough back. Would it be more authentic to regress to that way of doing things?\nIf you privately think your friend’s new baby isn\u0026rsquo;t the best looking child in the world, would you tell them in order to be authentic? Of course not. You would say the baby is beautiful.\nWhen learning the piano, would you resist your teacher’s advice to sit up straight to play with more power because it didn’t feel authentic? No. As with any other area of life, you would accept that you need to embrace new techniques in order to become better at the instrument.\nThe changes might be hard, uncomfortable and unnatural, but you would do it. It’s the same with learning to be a better presenter. If you want to become a more credible, confident and convincing presenter, you need to worry less about authenticity and be willing to follow a new approach. Dr. Michael F. Steger, Professor of Psychology at Colorado State University said: “You be you—but remember that “you” is an imperfect work in progress.” Of course you want to be original and to be yourself. You don’t want to be a copy of anybody else. But ‘you’ is a work in progress. So you need to work to become the best authentic version of yourself. In Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader, Herminia Ibarra coined the term ‘authenticity paradox’. She describes the difficult choice between being yourself (doing what comes naturally to you) and doing what it takes to be effective.\nIf you want to achieve results often it requires doing things that don’t come naturally.\nIn the context of business presentations there are good reasons to strive beyond what feels comfortable. The aim is to persuade an audience to follow your call to action, so you can achieve your goals.\nThese might include:\nGrowing a business Making sales Leading a team Raising funding Boosting influence, credibility and reputation If your motivation for working on your presentation skills is because you want to help the people you seek to serve—and realise your goals—then by making changes, you are being authentic. True authenticity has nothing to do with your behaviour, it’s the motivation behind the behaviour. For example, if I pay you a compliment, it could be sincere or I could be doing it out of courtesy. In other words, the same compliment could be authentic or inauthentic, depending on the motivation behind it. The same applies to any other behaviour, including your decision to take your presentation skills to a higher level.\nInstead of thinking about authenticity, focus on being professional and empathetic to your audience. Empathy is the key—the empathy to imagine what your audience would expect to hear, what their needs would be and what story would resonate with them. Three ways to stay true to yourself Think values, not feelings Stop concerning yourself so much with how you feel and focus on what you value. The best presenters will include emotion in presentations, make eye contact and use hand movements which connect with their message. Doing any of that for the first time when you are not used to it can feel unnatural and uncomfortable.\nBut you value your audience and value the results you’ll see from a great presentation. So your behaviour, and your presentation style, should be driven by that.\nIf you’re having a conversation with a friend and you feel bored, you would still not interrupt because you value the friendship.\nIt’s the same with an audience. Put their needs above yours.\nStart with self-awareness There’s no authenticity without self-awareness. Take a good look at yourself and be honest about your strengths and weaknesses. You must build on your strengths and overcome your weaknesses to become the best authentic version of yourself. You’ll have to work on areas that are uncomfortable and unnatural if you want to become more effective.\nAuthenticity cannot be used as an excuse for not trying to get better.\nDon’t hold yourself back There’s no static ‘you’. We’re constantly changing, learning and developing. You’re not the same person you were five, ten or twenty years ago.\nIn terms of your presentation skills, you’ll have improved since you first stood in front of people to deliver a message.\nAs you develop, you’re still the same person. You’re still authentic. You just have better presentation skills. So, don’t limit yourself to the ‘authentic’ person you used to be. Otherwise, you’ll hold yourself back. Summary Simon Sinek said that \u0026ldquo;Authenticity is more than speaking. Authenticity is also about doing. Every decision we make says something about who we are.” True authenticity is not about passively accepting who you are, it’s about making proactive decisions to become better, whilst remaining true to yourself.\nMaking the necessary changes to become better at presenting is not easy. It will push you outside your comfort zone. Some people resist this by claiming the new techniques and behaviours are somehow ‘inauthentic’.\nThat’s an excuse.\nTo realise your business goals you’ll have to push through the discomfort.\nTrue authenticity has nothing to do with how you’ve always acted. We’re evolving all the time. If you want to improve, then learning and adopting new behaviours is truly authentic.\nAuthenticity is a journey—a journey of constant growth toward the best presenter you can become. Feedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

I hear phrases like:\nWe’ve been the industry leader since 2010\nWe have 123 offices in 36 different countries\nWe have 7,500 clients across 80 industries We’re a pioneering company in our field\nWe make the world’s best cup of tea\nIt’s all about how wonderful we are. The problem with this sort of approach is that it doesn’t create a good connection with your audience. In fact, it creates distance between you.\nI’m sure we’ve all been stuck at a party with the person who brags about their own achievements. They’ve always done everything anybody mentions and bring the conversation back to themselves. There’s no space for others to participate. It’s so tedious you just want to walk away.\nIn communication, when you make it about you, you’re acting like that person. The audience wants to get up and leave.\nA more subtle mistake people make when telling stories or sharing case studies is failing to frame them in a narrative that includes the audience. In not doing so, we make ourselves, our brand, our company or our product the hero of the story.\nBut nobody cares about us. Our audience only cares about themselves and their needs. So you should tell stories that make them understand how your brand, company, product can help them get what they want.\nYou should relate your stories to the client or the audience and make it more about them. It needs to be their story not yours. In this article we applied a similar approach to your whole presentation. I discussed how you need to make it their presentation, not yours. It’s always the audience’s presentation. When you tell a story, the same principle. It’s their story not yours. As Donald Miller says in Building a StoryBrand, the client is the hero of the story. Your role should be that of a guide who gives the hero a plan, product, service or solution that helps them get what they want. Sales expert Mike Bosworth, author of books like Solution Selling and What Great Salespeople Do, says, \u0026ldquo;Be the wizard who gives the hero a magic sword.\u0026rdquo;\nThe way to achieve this, and implement what both Miller and Bosworth are saying, is to flip your case studies into success stories.\nThe way you transform your case studies is to turn them into narratives from the perspective of the real hero一your client. The client used to have a problem. Then a guide (you, your company, your brand) came along and provided the solution that helped them achieve success. There are two key elements which make this a great formula: It’s a narrative, which means that it follows a story framework. That makes your communication far more engaging, relatable and memorable. It’s told from the perspective of the client. It’s not about your success, it’s about the success of your clients. The client is the hero. Practical tips to liven up your stories It’s all very well explaining the theory一but how do we put these ideas into practice?\nIf you’re not a natural storyteller and don’t know how to start, let me offer some help.\nThe simplest way I found to implement the idea of success stories comes from the book Seven Stories Every Salesperson Must Tell by Mike Adams. He shares a straightforward four-step framework:\nSetting Complication Turning point Resolution Setting: All you need to do at the start is mention time and place. For example, ‘Three years ago we worked with ABC in London’. When you start a message with time (three years ago) and place (London), the audience knows you’re about to tell them a story.\nComplication: Here you describe the problem your client had. What problems, challenges and issues were your client (the hero) experiencing before they met you? Turning point: This is where you come along, not as the hero of the story, but as the guide. Explain how you helped your client solve their problem.\nResolution: Now put a spotlight on the success of your client. What did they achieve as a result of your help? Remember: it’s about them. It’s their story and success, not yours.\nA real life example We worked with a business leader at Circulor, a London-based B Corp which uses technology to help their clients make their supply chains traceable, ethical, and sustainable.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a success story she included in a presentation we developed together. Setting:\n‘Let me give you an example of a well known brand that’s already using our technology to improve their supply chain. Three years ago we started a first pilot with a global company with operations in Rwanda.’\nComplication: ‘One of the key components they need to source is batteries. The problem is that batteries use rare earth minerals that are only mined in places like Rwanda or Democratic Republic of the Congo一where some suppliers have human rights issues and other ethical problems. The brand cares deeply about their corporate responsibility, so the last thing they want is to be associated with a major disruption or scandal.’\nTurning point: So, they decided to try our solution for mapping their complex supply chain for batteries. The technology gives them an unprecedented level of traceability so they can confidently promote sustainable practices in their supply chain and provide better transparency for their customers.’\nResolution: ‘This pilot strengthened their commitment to an ethical supply chain, using raw materials with a net zero carbon footprint. It paved the way for the entire raw materials industry to achieve the goal of producing truly sustainable products. This project was so successful that our client expanded the use of our technology into other areas of their operations and they’re contributing to a more sustainable business.’\nBeing less focussed on yourself will bring rewards According to a Deloitte study, “Client-centric companies are 60% more profitable compared to companies not focused on the customer.”\nIf you can remember to relate your content, especially your case studies, to other people you’ll take your communication to a higher level. When you elevate your communication skills, you’ll also take your business to a higher level.\nSo, let’s get started.\nGo back over all the examples, stories and case studies you use in your communications (whether that be on your website, in your marketing materials or your presentations) and assess them against the story framework you’ve learned here.\nAsk yourself: Is the setting clear? Is the complication explained from the perspective of the client? Is it clear that your role is not the hero but a guide who supports the hero (your client)? Is the resolution about the success the client has experienced? If you answer no to any of these questions, turn your stories into powerful narratives that do follow this framework. Your communication and your business will soar as a result.\nSummary Talking too much about yourself is dull. It’s like the person at a party who just bores on about themselves.\nIf you do that to an audience during a business presentation you’ll lose them. That means you’ll miss out on business opportunities.\nA better approach is to relate any examples, stories or case studies to your audience. Demonstrate how you helped someone or can help someone.\nThe client needs to be the hero of any case study, not you. Your role is that of the enabler who helped the client achieve success.\nAn easy way to bring stories to life and make them relatable is to focus on the setting (time and place), the complication (the problem the client faced), the turning point (how you helped them) and the resolution (what they achieved).\nFrom now on, whenever you want to include a story in a presentation, apply that simple four step process.\nFeedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

They believe their job is to speak for 30 minutes while others listen.\nThese kinds of presentations, which don’t consider the needs of the audience, are tedious and unsuccessful.\nHow do we do things differently? In this article I’ll explore how to bring the audience into your presentations and make them feel involved.\nConversation not presentation In her book Presenting Virtually, Patti Sanchez says, rather than a presentation being a one-way lecture, it should be a designed conversation. A presentation should feel like a conversation. If you can manage to achieve that, your presentations will always be engaging and interactive. If the audience feels like they’re helping to create the presentation with you, they’ll want to listen and will feel more involved.\nAn audience who sees that you’re considering their needs, questions and priorities will feel more valued.\nHave you ever driven your car when you were tired? You probably had that heavy feeling in your eyes and were desperate to close them and get some rest. But you couldn’t.\nLet’s say your partner was there with you but they were unable to drive because they’d had a few drinks or they were even more tired than you. So it fell to you to be the nominated driver.\nA good partner does everything they can to interact and help to keep you awake. They’ll ask you questions, share anecdotes or select a great playlist on Spotify and sing along.\nWell it’s exactly the same in a presentation. A good presenter will do anything to keep the audience awake and engaged.\nAs Patti Sanchez says, it’s designed conversation, not just conversation. What she means is that the conversational element of a presentation一the moments of interaction with the audience一are not left to chance. They’re planned in advance.\nIf you’re interested in hearing more from Patti, I interviewed her for our Ideas on Stage Podcast which you can find here. How often should you interact with your audience? A professor from Imperial College London decided to apply some science to boring presentations. Robert Ewers, who attends numerous academic conferences in his role as Professor of Ecology, wanted to establish whether dull presentations are longer or just seem that way.\nSo he sat through 50 talks, timed them, and made a decision after four minutes whether they were boring or not.\nHe discovered that the 34 talks he found interesting lasted, on average, 11 minutes and 42 seconds. The 16 boring ones went on for an average of 13 minutes and 12 seconds.\nProfessor Ewers concluded that the chances of a presentation being boring doubled every 70 seconds.\nI like to keep things simple and apply the ten-minute rule.\nThe attention of your audience will rapidly decline after about ten minutes. It doesn’t matter how good you are as a presenter or how interesting your subject is. Ten minutes are enough for most people. It’s wired into our physiology.\nSo, what does this mean for you? If your presentation has to be longer than ten minutes, because you have a certain amount of material to get through, break it down further into ten-minute segments. In between each ten-minute chunk find a way to maintain the audience’s attention or to win it back.\nYou need to interact with the audience every ten minutes. What about online? It’s even harder to keep an audience engaged online. There are too many distractions for them and you don’t have a direct connection.\nIn a webinar, for example, some people will have their cameras turned off. Everyone has mastered the art of trying to look as though they’re concentrating while secretly checking their emails, football scores or feeding their dog.\nSo, the ten-minute rule becomes the three-minute rule online.\nIn an online presentation, you need to interact with your audience every three minutes or so. In my experience, a moment of interaction every three to five minutes works well. A real life example I worked with Nicola Askham, also known as The Data Governance Coach, to develop an online presentation for potential clients. The subject of her talk was The 6 Principles for Successful Data Governance. It was advice on how organisations can design and implement successful Data Governance frameworks.\nWe made sure we had a moment of interaction for each of her key messages. I’ve summarised them below so you can see how we broke it down.\nNicola designed these moments of interaction in advance. She knew she had to ask those questions. Even when she rehearsed her presentation, she rehearsed the interactions as well. As you can see, it doesn’t have to be complicated. As long as you involve the audience in the conversation, they’ll appreciate it. Summary Too many business leaders fail to interact with the audience. We all know what it feels like to be spoken to without any participation. It’s boring.\nThe best presentations feel more like conversations.\nRather than leave moments of interaction down to chance, prepare them in advance. Create a designed conversation for your audience.\nPeople’s attention spans last about ten minutes. So incorporate moments of interaction every ten minutes or so.\nOnline it’s even more difficult to keep people engaged, so bring that down to every three or five minutes.\nThe best way to plan moments of interaction is to look at what your key messages are, and align them to those.\nFeedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

When I ask them if they think they’re doing it well they usually say yes. But that’s rarely the case.\nToo many presenters assume that their data is intrinsically meaningful.\n“Here’s the data: take it, use it, understand it, remember it.” That’s how we often communicate data. Unfortunately, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like that. As presenters, it’s our responsibility to communicate data so that it means something to the audience. The way to do that is to tell the story behind the data.\nBestselling author Dan Heath said, “Data are just summaries of thousands of stories—tell a few of those stories to help make the data meaningful.”\nWhat he means is that there’s a difference between data and insight. Data alone is not meaningful unless we turn it into insight. If we can turn data into insight it can become a powerful tool to drive action from the audience—which is the fundamental aim of most business presentations.\nMaking data relatable Nancy Duarte, CEO of Duarte, Inc., explains that there are three ways to put data into perspective.\nIn her book DataStory: Explain Data and Inspire Action Through Story she gives these three tips:\nConnect data to relatable size Connect data to relatable time Connect data to relatable things You make data ‘relatable’ by putting it into perspective and making it familiar to the audience. Let’s put this into practice. Connect data to relatable size\nSize means length, width, height, thickness, or distance. One of our clients wanted to communicate how their software had saved their customers from driving 250,000 miles. Their application allowed workers to do certain tasks remotely instead of having to travel to specific locations. They decided to try and help the audience to visualise how great that distance was. So they said it was like driving the length of Great Britain (which is around 600 miles) more than 400 times. It was a compelling way to bring the 250,000 miles to life in a relatable way. Everyone in the UK can understand what it would be like to drive between Lands End and John o’Groats 400 times.\nRemember: it’s always about the audience. I’ve written more about how to make a presentation related to the audience here. Connect data to relatable time\nTime is an excellent way of putting data into perspective, especially when it comes to explaining the value of money.\nAnother of our clients wanted to communicate that she’d sold 100,000 units of her product in the last three years. She was keen to demonstrate that there was high demand for her product. So she broke it down to (roughly) 100 products sold every day. Again, much more relatable.\nConnect data to relatable things\nYou can also put data into perspective by connecting it to things that are familiar to the audience.\nSome time ago I stumbled upon a video about the blue whale by National Geographic. The video explained that the blue whale is the largest living animal to have ever existed. The largest blue whales can be more than 100 feet (30 metres) long. To help people visualise 30 metres they said that it’s the same length as three school buses. What a perfect way to make that relatable.\nImagine three school buses put together. The blue whale is as large as that!\nThe business benefits of making data more relatable We were approached by Ollie and Jack Farrer, the co-founders of paid media agency Farrer, to help them communicate their data and insights in a more engaging manner.\nThey wanted to get better at running meetings, making pitches and presenting proposals, which have lots of data in them.\nOllie and Jack were keen for their team to improve their proposals so they would stand out, win bigger clients and become more confident at communicating their ideas.\nThe Farrer team came along to one of our workshops and one of the focuses of the session was making their data more relatable.\nWe worked with them to ensure that the session was specific to the challenges they face as a paid media agency. Farrer has specific needs which go beyond presentations. But they were able to apply the same techniques to their other areas of business—like meetings, pitches and proposals.\nOllie and Jack told us later that they had loved the workshop and their whole team was energised by it. They said there were many lightbulb moments among their team and they now look forward to pitching ideas and proposals. Tips on using data in a presentation For your next presentation: every time you want to communicate some data, ask yourself how you can put it into perspective. How can you extract meaning from your data? How can you communicate it so it makes sense to the audience? So that the data means something to them? A good technique is to complete the following sentence:\n[Your number] is equivalent to_________________________.\nFor example, as we saw above:\n250,000 miles is equivalent to driving the length of Great Britain more than 400 times. 100,000 products sold in three years is equivalent to 100 products per day. 30 metres is equivalent to three school buses.\nIf you can draw these relatable comparisons, you can unlock the power of data to tell your audience something they didn’t know before; that they didn’t see before; that they didn’t understand before.\nThis is how data can drive action.\nSummary Data and numbers usually play an important part in any business presentation. We often find ourselves having to communicate financial targets or sales targets.\nThe problem is that data on its own can be boring and hard to understand.\nMany presenters fail to communicate data in a way that makes it interesting.\nThe way to bring data alive is to make it relatable. It’s good to put data into perspective by connecting it to size, time or things which the audience understands.\nIf you can learn how to present data well your business presentations will be more effective and you will reap the rewards.\nFeedback If you enjoyed this article, I would love to hear your feedback.

They wrongly assume that the audience will understand something just because they do.\nThis becomes even more of an issue when the subject matter is difficult, technical or new to the audience. Under those circumstances, it becomes even more important to present the ideas in a clear way. Otherwise the audience won’t remember anything nor act in the way you hope they will.\nIn this article I’m going to explore the power of analogies to help you communicate your ideas in an original and enjoyable way. What is an analogy? An analogy is a comparison between one thing and another—usually, to clarify or explain something.\nUsing analogies is a powerful way to help an audience understand an unfamiliar concept. By linking something they don’t know with something they do, you create a connection for them. The best way to explain something new is to connect it to something the audience already knows.\nSteve Jobs once said: “Creativity is just connecting things.” When presenting, one of the best things you can do to make your messages original and enjoyable is to connect things. Learning, understanding and retention happen when you make connections.\n3 examples of great analogies Below are some real examples of analogies our clients have used. For each example I’ve included some information about the context, the idea the presenter wanted to communicate and the analogy they used to illustrate the idea. 1) Diversity and Inclusion and Rome’s Metro Line C\nContext: Presentation on the topic of Diversity and Inclusion. Idea: We make lots of assumptions around Diversity and Inclusion. Unless we go deeper on certain issues and really try to understand what’s behind the surface, we’ll get stuck and we won’t move forward.\nAnalogy: I lived in Rome a few years ago when they were building the third metro line. Every few weeks work would stop because they would often find old archaeological sites which had to be protected. There had to be an extensive archaeological investigation before they could continue. Unless you go deeper on certain issues, like Diversity and Inclusion, and properly investigate what’s behind the surface, you won’t move forward. 2) Supply chain and food diary Context: Software for supply chain management. Idea: Our software makes the invisible visible. It gives you accurate data on the areas of your supply chain which are hard to see and hard to measure. This allows you to understand where your organisation is doing well and where it needs improvement.\nAnalogy: A friend of mine went to a dietician recently. She told her, “I know I’m overweight, but I can’t see why. I\u0026rsquo;m not eating that much.” The dietician suggested that she start keeping a food diary. After keeping it for a few days, the food diary showed why she was overweight. She was eating a bit too much. Often we can’t see things unless they’re in front of us. The same happens when you manage your supply chain. There are many issues which seem invisible. They are there but we can’t see them. So it’s necessary to keep a ‘food diary’. That’s what our software does. Think of it as your food diary which allows you to see what’s going on with your supply chain. 3) Anger and homelessness\nContext: TEDxBrighton, Can Anger be Good for you? by Margaret Rose-Goddard.\nIdeas: Anger is a more useful feeling than sadness.\nAnalogy: What often drives human behaviour is anger. Anger can be good for you. But it\u0026rsquo;s important to distinguish anger from sadness. Sadness gets us stuck whereas anger moves us forward. If I see a homeless person on the street and feel sad about it, nothing happens. But if I feel angry, I want to do something about it. I want to help that person. Action and change often happen as a result of someone feeling angry about something. Anger can be good for you, once you do the work to consciously channel it for change. A life-changing analogy I interviewed John Pollack for the Ideas on Stage podcast who shared a brilliant anecdote about how an analogy helped him land a job as one of President Bill Clinton’s speechwriters.\nJohn is the author of Shortcut: How Analogies Reveal Connections, Spark Innovation, and Sell Our Greatest Ideas. He also embarked on an unusual mission as a young boy: to collect enough wine corks to build a boat. Amassing enough corks took longer than he expected, and over the years, it became something of a running joke in his family.\nThirty years later, as an adult, John revived the idea and started seriously collecting corks from bars, restaurants and even a cork company. As he was collecting corks, he was called to The White House for a job interview.\nThe President’s chief speechwriter asked John about the cork boat project, which was mentioned on the bottom of his CV. When John started to explain, the chief speechwriter looked sceptical. John could feel his dream job slipping away.\nOn the spur of the moment, he came up with an analogy: that building a cork boat is a lot like writing a great speech. In both cases, you take a jumble of small things, words or corks, which don’t do much on their own. But if you put them into just the right order, they’ll take you on an amazing journey.\nThe chief speechwriter got the analogy, and John got the job. After leaving The White House at the end of the Clinton administration, John fulfilled his dream, building a 22-foot Viking sailing boat out of 165,321 corks and sailing it down Portugal’s Douro River.\nSummary The more we know about a subject, the harder it becomes to present it in a simple way. Yet the art of good communication is keeping things simple.\nThis is where analogies are useful. An analogy is when you draw a comparison between one thing and another. Use analogies to communicate concepts and ideas which are complex, technical or new. That’s what great communicators do. Feedback I love to hear from people who’ve read my articles and improved their presentations.

Your presentation will have been in vain.\nFor example, imagine you were giving a webinar or an introductory workshop on your area of expertise. The objective is for the audience to sign up for a discovery call to see if you can work together. Most presenters say something like: ‘If you think you need a bit of help on (their area of expertise), I’m happy to offer a discovery call.’\nThe problem is that even if someone was interested in a discovery call, they don’t know how to book one in. So they won’t do it. The call to action isn’t specific enough.\nMany presenters miss out on an enormous amount of business opportunities simply because their calls to action are not specific enough. Seven elements to an effective call to action Let’s break down the key components of an effective call to action. These characteristics are mainly relevant to sales presentations but you’ll be able to learn something here for any presentation. All business presentations are selling something—whether it\u0026rsquo;s an idea, a project, yourself or your business. You don’t need to use all of these elements. See what works for you, based on your audience, the context and what makes you comfortable. 1) Be specific\nHere’s how the above example, with the vague offer of a discovery call, could have been better phrased:\n‘If you enjoyed this session and you’d like to learn more about what we’ve covered today, at the moment I have an opportunity for three complimentary consultations to see if there might be a fit between what you’re looking for and what we have to offer. Regardless of whether or not there’s a good fit, I can promise you that you’ll walk away with much greater clarity on how you can (fill the blank). So, if you’re interested, just type ‘yes’ in the chat now and I’ll get in touch to see if you qualify. And if that’s the case, we’ll arrange a time for a call.’\nIn this case people know what they have to do to signal their interest. They simply need to type ‘yes’ in the chat. It’s a small change that makes a huge difference.\n2) Include a logical next step It’s often inappropriate to move into full-on sales mode during an initial presentation一especially at something like an educational webinar or an introductory workshop on your area of expertise. So, what’s an alternative logical next step? The best approach is one which makes sense to the audience based on where they are right now.\nIt could be that the audience books or expresses their interest in a consultation or discovery session—as we\u0026rsquo;ve been looking at.\nOr you could invite them to complete a quiz to ascertain the areas in which they perform well and the areas they need to improve.\nAlternatively, you could offer them access to some free resources to learn more about how you can help them. This is usually in return for their contact details.\nThe possibilities are endless. What’s important is that you’re clear about the logical next step, which may or may not be a sale. In Ramit Sethi’s book I Will Teach You to Be Rich, he says: “The way you get people to floss is to just ask them to floss one tooth. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Suddenly, they are \u0026ldquo;flossing.\u0026rdquo; Their brains say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the type of person who likes to floss.\u0026rdquo; Maybe after a day or two they start flossing two teeth. And why stop there? After a few weeks they are flossing all of their teeth because their brain sees it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as hard a habit as they thought.” Your next logical step should follow this principle of leading your audience at an appropriate pace towards your end goal. Start with one tooth and take it from there. 3) Include an immediate next step Not only does the next step need to be logical, ideally it should also be immediate. If you ask the audience to type ‘yes’ in the chat during a webinar, or to fill out a form during an in-person workshop expressing interest on the spot, that’s immediate.\nAlways try to think how to make the next step as immediate as possible, even when it seems hard to do.\n4) Sell the opportunity\nYou have something valuable to offer to those you seek to serve. So don’t be shy about it. This is an opportunity for them. Of course it helps you and your business too, but it also helps your audience. Frame what you want your audience to do as an opportunity for them, not as something you need from them. Language matters and using the phrase ‘I have an opportunity’ can be powerful.\n‘\u0026hellip; at the moment I have an opportunity for three complimentary consultations …’\n5) Create scarcity and/or urgency In our example, where the presenter is offering complimentary consultations, we limited it to three. This helps to create tension.\n‘I have an opportunity for three complimentary consultations …’\nIf everybody can reserve a consultation, there’s no tension. If only three people can do it, it helps to drive demand for your offer.\nThis works in person if you ask participants to fill out a form and others can see them doing it. It also works in a webinar where everyone can see the chat responses. If ten people all signal their interest, knowing there are only three spaces, that\u0026rsquo;s the sort of tension you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. To create yet more tension the presenter could have said that the opportunity has a time limit. The opportunity for the complimentary consultation might expire in two or three days.\nOf course, this has to be genuine or you’ll undermine your credibility. You don’t want to be salesy and pushy. In our example, our presenter could work out how many consultations she actually needs to have (and how often) to hit her sales targets. If she knows she needs to have three consultations after each presentation and she gives one presentation per week, that’s where urgency and scarcity come from.\n6) Give reassurance\nIt’s helpful to soften the sales element of your call to action by offering reassurance that there’s no obligation, nor any pressure. Make it clear that the audience is expressing interest rather than committing to anything more.\n‘Regardless of whether or not there’s a good fit, I can promise you that you’ll walk away with much greater clarity on how you can (fill the blank).’ What the presenter is saying here is that it may or may not be a good fit. They may end up working together or not. Either way, it doesn’t matter. 7) Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s not confusing Resist the temptation to include too many elements in your call to action. You only need one next step and I would never include more than two.\nNo one wants to book a follow-up call, download a report, take your quiz, read your article, join your private Facebook group and buy from you today.\nThis is confusing. The end result of asking for too much is that the audience will do nothing. Choose one logical next step and stick to it. You could have a secondary call to action, but that’s it. No more than that. My call to action to you Now it’s time for me to deliver a call to action to you. For your next presentation try the following tips:\nThink about your objective. What do you want your audience to do? Prepare a clear and specific call to action Make sure it meets most of the seven characteristics above Summary The purpose behind most business presentations is to encourage an action from the audience.\nThe aim is not to share information.\nTherefore, it’s crucial for you to include a compelling call to action at the end of your presentation.\nA good call to action will:\nBe specific Include a logical next step Include an immediate next step Sell an opportunity Create urgency and/or scarcity Provide reassurance—to make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem salesy Not be confusing and only include one or two next steps Feedback If you enjoyed this article, I would love to hear from you.

I think so, or at least that is what I would appreciate. So here are my three minutes’ worth for you.\nIt’s high time to get live presentations kicking again. But can we go back to them seamlessly like before? It can be a little daunting after such a long spell presenting virtually. We’re so used to seeing a wall of participants with cameras off and hearing the sound of compressed silence when we take a pause for thought. It’s now time to dust off our soft skills and get back in the ring in front of live audiences with clicker in hand, slides behind us and a sea of people waiting to be wowed. So, when you have to take the stage, what’s the hardest part? The first couple of minutes. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a little check-list of actions to get us through those moments? To help ground us and anchor us? Well, I have one I’ve been working on for a few years now. I call it the C-Spark. C-Spark is a checklist acronym that I run though in my head each time I walk out in front of an audience – and it works! Center -\nScan\nPlant\nAsk\nReach-out\nKonnect*\nThe C is for Center Yourself. Whileyou’re backstage or waiting in the audience to come on stage (or to get up to speak in your meeting room), take a moment to center yourself and focus. Take a few deep breaths and look to calm the area around you. Calm yourself by disengaging in conversation with peers and try to keep your brain alert but calm. The next five items are when you get out there on the floor: Scan (your surroundings). As you take your mark, take it all in. Presence is externalizing your attention and reacting to external stimulus. Take in the audience, the sound, the vibe. Don’t cut yourself off from it by fretting inwards. Look at the audience as you make your way over. Plant deep (plant yourself and take a breath). Find your mark, plant your feet, breathe deeply and take all the time in the world to gather your first thoughts. Ask (the audience). Once you’ve planted yourself, open your shoulders, widen your arms as if to make a small embrace, and smile, as if asking for their attention and creating visual contact. The last two are a combination:\nReach out \u0026amp; Konnect. With an open hand gesture, Reach out to someone specific in the audience, Konnect with your eyes with them and proceed to speak your first idea to them. Repeat for the following idea/line with another person and Reach out and Konnect. This should give you forward momentum and energy. Continue this throughout the presentation. Pause between your phrases.\nThere you have it. Under three minutes. But these techniques might take you three days, or three months to perfect. Have a go! And if you are a stickler for detail, find a coach, family member, or colleague to present to, and incorporate their advice and learn from their reactions.\nWhile you may very well be an expert in your subject, keep in mind that ‘the audience always knows best’ ;-)\nAnd of course I have much to share on that topic, but my three minutes are over!\nThank you.\n* I know this should be Connect, but it’s easier to remember C-SPARK than C-SPARC. Anyway, poetic license!\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/10/05/2022-10-05-what_to_do_the_minute_you_take_the_stage_c-spark/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What to do the minute you take the stage? C-SPARK"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":" The first words of a presentation are the most important. Your opening needs to grab the audience’s attention and hold it.\nThe philosopher Plato said: “The beginning is the most important part of the work.”\nSadly, most business leaders don’t think carefully enough about the way they open their presentations. Instead, they focus on the main body of their presentation and leave the opening to chance.\nOr they make the common mistake of opening with a boring agenda slide or by introducing themselves. Those openings don’t work and won’t capture the audience’s attention.\nAudience members don’t care about us and our agenda. They only care about themselves and their needs. If you don’t seize the opportunity to deliver a great opening you’ll lose the audience and it will be hard to win them back.\nIn a Formula 1 race it’s a huge advantage to start in pole position at the front of the grid. The driver who starts in first place is more likely to win because there is no one to overtake and much of the hard work has been done.\nYou can apply that analogy to a presentation. If you can get off to a flying start, the rest of the presentation is more likely to go well and you’ll achieve your aims.\nSeven examples of good openings Here are some suggestions of tactics you can use for your introductions. You could use any of them on their own or combine more than one technique together.\nThe options below also include examples, either my own or from our clients. I’ve anonymised the client examples for confidentiality reasons. 1. What next This is the simplest introduction which always works well. Here you tell the audience what to expect from the presentation一what’s coming next, what you’re going to cover and what they’ll get out of it.\nYou can say something like:\n‘In this presentation I’m going to cover three main points: Message 1 Message 2 Message 3 By the end of this presentation, you’ll \u0026hellip; [what will they get out of it]’\n2. Context, Problem, Solution\nIn this type of introduction you provide a context, which is the current state of things as it relates to your message. Then you introduce a problem before offering a solution to that problem.\nHere is an example of this put into practice:\nContext: ‘In this presentation I’m going to talk about workplace safety. We could avoid a lot of occupational accidents just by increasing knowledge and using simple information systems that help companies track, identify and eliminate risk at work.’\nProblem: ‘However, the reality is different. For example, did you know that in 2019—in the UK alone—we lost more than 38 million workdays due to work-related accidents? Not only that, but every year an unacceptably high number of people work in unsafe and unhealthy work environments. And this of course places costs on the employees, the businesses and the environment.\nSo, the question we must ask ourselves is, Why? Why with all the information and guidelines available do we continue to have workplace incidents?’\nSolution:\n‘At ABC we have a solution. We are passionate about developing user-friendly software that improves the flow of information and streamlines all the documentation you need so you can reduce your safety risks related to the workplace. Let me show you how it works.’\n3. You want to be, for that you need, the problem is\nThink about what your audience wants to achieve and start by stating that. Then tell them what they need to do if they want to be successful. Add the tension of a potential problem to get them even more interested.\nHere’s an example of this type of introduction:\n‘I’m here today because you mentioned you want to understand how 3D printing can be of value to your business. For that you need to have an idea of what can be done with 3D printing as a production process. The problem is, up until now most engineers haven’t been considering 3D printing as a production option, but only as a prototyping and experimental technology.\nWe want to change that! Recently, some of this technology has matured to the point where it has the speed, stability and economics to become a viable production process. So, in this presentation I’m going to show you how you can add 3D printing as a versatile tool in your production toolbox.’\n4. A surprising fact or a shocking statistic Here you hit the audience immediately with a striking fact.\nFor example, the introduction above about work-related accidents could be adapted to this style.\n‘Did you know that in 2019—in the UK alone—we lost more than 38 million workdays due to work-related accidents?’\n5. A relevant quotation\nIf an authority or an expert in your field has said something interesting, relevant to the message you want to get across, try starting with that.\nOne of our clients who was giving a presentation on the importance of hiring with purpose (i.e. hiring with the right values), started this way.\n‘Today I’m going to talk about why as startup founders you should hire with purpose. As Marc Benioff (CEO of Salesforce) said, “The secret to a successful hire is this: look for the people who want to change the world”.’\nOur client went on to explain the quotation in more detail later in the presentation in the context of the message he wanted to convey. 6. A thought-provoking question\nA great way to kick off a presentation is with a question. Here’s an example of a question which would be suitable for an introduction which I found in the book The Mission Corporation by Michael T Moe and Michael M Carter.\nI’ve updated the language from the original material to make it work better in this context.\n‘Imagine how great it would be if the entrepreneurs of the future refused to act only in their own self-interest and were instead driven by purpose and desire to act in the interest of all. Even better, if they were rewarded for doing that. What difference would that make?\nIn this presentation I’m going to talk about the impact that capitalism has had in the world and what now needs to be improved on to ensure it adapts to reflect the values of future generations.’ 7. A story, metaphor or analogy This is my favourite technique. Think about the main message you want to convey, then ask yourself, ‘Is there a story, a metaphor or an analogy that I can use to illustrate my point?’\nFor example, in one of my workshops—where I give an introduction to becoming a more confident presenter—I start with the analogy that a presentation is like a first date.\n‘A presentation is an opportunity to make a great first impression. It’s like a first date. The problem I see is that most people and companies make the huge mistake of making an invisible first impression when presenting.\nIt’s not that they make a bad first impression (although that often happens), but it’s also not a good first impression. It’s just invisible. And we want to change that. That’s what we’re going to do today. So, by the end of this workshop you’ll have a very good understanding of how you can be a more visible, impactful and confident presenter.’\nSummary The opening section of a presentation is your chance to grab the audience’s attention and maintain it.\nDon’t waste time introducing yourself or showing the audience an agenda slide. People are not interested in you. They care about themselves and their needs.\nYou don’t have to try and be too clever. Just telling the audience what you’ll be talking about is a great way to start.\nOther good opening ideas are to explain a problem you’ll solve for the audience or to hit them with a thought-provoking quotation, fact or question.\nMy favourite opening is when you use a story, metaphor or analogy which is relevant to your key message.\nWhichever type of introduction you use, time spent working on an opening is always worthwhile.\nFeedback Please comment, get in touch or share the article with any colleagues or friends who might benefit from the ideas.

Drawing on a 70s Kung Fu star to get some presentation tips! For those who don’t know Bruce Lee, he was an icon of the 1970s whose movies including Enter the Dragon and Fist of Fury have inspired generations. He was both impressive and also rather eccentric. Crafting his own philosophy during his relatively short life, he was quoted saying some interesting things.\nNone more interesting than this quote: \u0026ldquo;Be Water, My Friend. Empty your mind.\nBe formless, shapeless, like water. You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.\u0026rdquo;\nGreat stuff. I personally find this opaque but strangely inspiring. So how on earth do you apply this to presenting? Well, I’m ready to explain my idea. In my view presenting is a little like combat, one where the biggest enemy, like combat, is oneself. One of the biggest self-defeating things we can do is try to control everything. Water is the opposite of this. It’s free-flowing, unobstructed and powerful. So how can you be like water when you present? There are three things I will take from Lee’s philosophy:\nWater is formless. Firstly presenters should learn to surrender the outcome. Although it’s good to fix an objective, knowing where you want to go and what you want to achieve, it’s good to also know that how you get there can vary from moment to moment. So by being formless, in the sense of letting go, surrendering outcomes, there is less pressure and fewer nerves. My experience has taught me this greatly and I have strongly diminished the fear of public speaking for myself. Water is permeable. In other words, free one’s natural self. Bruce Lee often talked about the permeable nature of water, that it can absorb into everything, even in rock. What if our personalities were like that? If left to flow as intended (and not suppressed) it would help us to form connections with those listening to us in the audience and begin to build trust. Water can flow or it can crash. This is the power that we have to follow our impulses when the moment allows for it. To increase our energy output when we crescendo, use a pause to get the audience hooked, adapt our rhythm in the moment and play with the timing. Bruce Lee was also quoted saying this: “Staying \u0026lsquo;calm\u0026rsquo; in any situation, be it when you are angry, sad or under pressure is indeed a super power“.\nThis is indeed an advanced state of being, fodder even for all the greatest leaders. If things start to go wrong and you can keep calm it will earn you respect. Calm is indeed difficult for some of us but it can be attained with daily work, particularly around meditation and the breath. Like all disciplines, such as learning Kung Fu or Jeet Kune Do, it’s always better to learn from a master than just read an article. That’s why working with a coach will help you unlock all this potential when you get on stage. Surrender the outcome, let your true self permeate and follow your impulses to make an impact. It takes work to calm the self but still water runs deep.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/09/28/2022-09-28-be_water_my_friend/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"“Be Water my friend“"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":" The greatest films, TV shows and novels are the ones with the best storylines. The same is true for presentations. A strong narrative can help you bring your presentation alive and make it memorable and successful. However, most business owners, leaders and professionals don’t pay enough attention to the way they structure their presentations. They fail to develop a clear storyline.\nI’ve come across many presenters who simply improvise their presentation around some slides. Their ‘storyline’ tends to be a sequence of predictable slides we’ve all seen a million times before. There’s a title slide, an agenda slide and then a series of others.\nWhen a series of slides don’t follow any structure, the audience is unlikely to be fully engaged. When the participants leave the meeting they don’t understand what has been said, they won’t remember it and they won’t take action. The key messages aren’t clear.\nThe benefits of a clear storyline If your presentation follows a clear structure, your audience will be able to follow what you’re saying more easily一and they’ll understand and remember your key messages. It’s more likely they’ll take action from what you’ve said.\nAnother benefit of having a clear structure is that you as the presenter will find it much easier to remember your key messages too. Even if you lose your way in the middle of a presentation and go blank, it’s going to be easier to remember what the next section is and get back on track.\nThe aim of a great presentation is to take your audience on a journey from A to B. You want to transport them from not knowing something to understanding it; from not believing to believing; from not feeling to feeling. The journey will hopefully persuade them to do what you want them to do.\nCreating a storyline for a presentation is like baking a cake. The order in which you use the ingredients makes a big difference. To make a Tiramisu (a proper traditional Italian one) you first beat the egg whites until stiff and set it to one side. You mix the egg yolks, mascarpone and sugar in a separate bowl. It’s only once that other mixture is ready that you gently fold in the stiff egg whites. If you try to mix in the egg whites too early it won’t work.\nIn just the same way, the structure of a presentation and how you put it together makes a big difference.\nAccording to Matt Abrahams, a lecturer in Organisational Behaviour at Stanford University Graduate School of Business, “people retain structured information up to 40% more reliably and accurately than information that is presented in a more freeform manner.” What is the best storyline? Depending on the needs of your audience and what you’re trying to achieve, there are different storylines that work better than others. However, there’s one structure that works all the time. It’s a six step structure that you can apply to any type of presentation, regardless of the context, the audience or their needs.\nHere’s a clear presentation structure:\nLet’s look at this structure in more detail and unpack it.\nOpening This is the introduction to your presentation. Note I say the introduction, not your introduction. Most presenters make the mistake of introducing themselves at the start of a presentation.\nWhen you start by introducing yourself you’ll never capture the audience’s attention. No one cares that much about you (or me). They only care about themselves. A better way to start is by talking about the audience and involving them. You need to tell them why they should care about your presentation. What’s in it for them? Why should they listen to you? Now you’ve captured your audience’s attention, and put them first, you can introduce yourself.\nMain body — Three key messages The main body of your presentation should be your three key messages and the relevant supporting points. This is where, in addition to sharing information, facts and figures, you should include stories, examples and analogies.\nThese personal anecdotes are what will make your presentations more original and enjoyable.\nUsing the Rule of Three to get your points across is incredibly powerful, as I’ve previously explored here. The article also includes an example from one of our clients.\nRecap You’ve delivered your three key messages in the main body of the presentation, now briefly summarise the key takeaway.\nDon’t worry about the fact you’re echoing what you’ve already told them. Repetition is good in communication.\nIf you have an important message to get across and you tell your audience once, they’ll forget it. If you tell them twice or three times during a presentation, they’ll take it away.\nWhat’s important is to mix up the delivery and use some different words and phrases. It would be boring if your recap was an identical repeat of the same sentences. If you deliver the same message in different ways, that’s good repetition.\nThe aim of the Recap is to focus on the one thing you want your audience to take away from your presentation. Keep your Recap as brief as possible. When you summarise your presentation, if it takes more than one breath, cut it back.\nNext steps Most presenters don’t make it clear to the audience what they want them to do after the presentation一or they are not specific enough about the actions. Remember: a presentation is not a mind-reading exercise. You can’t expect your audience to know what you want them to do. You need to spell it out clearly and tell them what action to take.\nDo you want them to express their interest in a discovery call? Tell them.\nDo you want them to start collaborating with you? Tell them. Do you want them to agree to have a more in-depth conversation with your technical team? Tell them. Q\u0026amp;A Another common mistake presenters make is they include the Q\u0026amp;A (Questions \u0026amp; Answers) at the end of their presentations.\nThey bring their presentations to a faltering finish and then say something like: “Um…ok…that’s it for today…Do you have any questions? Do yourself a favour and don’t do that! You should never end a presentation with a Q\u0026amp;A. A presentation should end on your terms with your own conclusion. The last point you make should be to state again your key message and why they should care about it. A much better approach is to include the Q\u0026amp;A before your conclusion. The Q\u0026amp;A is important because it allows you to interact with your audience and address their concerns. But it’s not a good way to finish a presentation. What - So what - What next Now you’ve done the Q\u0026amp;A session it’s finally time for your conclusion—the last words you’ll leave your audience with. This is your opportunity to leave them with the one point you want them to take away from your presentation. The question is一what is it?\nThis is similar to the question I asked you for the Recap section. Remember: repetition is good in communication.\nA great way to end a presentation is to follow the What - So what - What next format as follows:\nWhat: What’s the one thing the audience needs to remember? So what: Why should they care? Why is it important to them? What next: Now that they care, what do you want them to believe, feel or do? A real life example We previously worked with Toby Trimble, MD and Founder of Trimble Productions, who develops world-class educational programmes for thought-leaders in the veterinary industry.\nToby came to us because he felt he used a lot of filler words and phrases like ‘um’ and ‘er’ when presenting一and relied on improvisation too much, thinking that was a way to come across well. Toby had been listening back to recordings of himself doing presentations and felt he seemed unprepared.\nHe wanted to become a more proficient speaker who people would be excited to listen to.\nOnce we helped Toby to put a clear structure in place he discovered that it helped him grab the audience’s attention immediately and keep them engaged. Finishing with a strong punchline became important to him.\nToby is now doing presentations a couple of times a week and being booked for speaking engagements. People have seen him speak and been impressed by the quality of his presentations. He told me that he feels much more confident and empowered to be a proficient public face of his company.\nSummary Having a clear storyline will elevate your presentations and ensure that your audience understands your key message.\nPutting together a deck with a series of slides is not a storyline, no matter how much work has gone into it.\nYou need to take your audience on a journey and leave them in no doubt at the end what you want them to take away from the session.\nThere are many possible storylines for presentations.\nHowever, a simple and effective structure which always works is to break it down into six elements:\nOpening: introduce what you will talk about and then yourself Main body: your three key messages Recap: when you re-iterate the key take away Next steps: your chance to deliver a call to action to the audience Q\u0026amp;A: the moment you offer to take any questions What - So what - What next: your closing remarks when you tell the audience the one thing you would like them to remember Feedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

It would be strange if you didn’t. The vast majority of people are afraid of public speaking. It’s perfectly normal to have a fear of public speaking, also known by its technical name of glossophobia.\nResearch shows that more than 75 percent of the population has some level of public speaking anxiety. So you’re in good company.\nI’m a presentation coach and I feel nervous all the time before a presentation. There’s a brilliant quote attributed to Mark Twain. He is believed to have said, “There are two types of speakers: those who are nervous and those who are liars.”\nIt’s common to feel nervous before speaking in public, even among accomplished presenters.\nThis can happen in many different contexts, not just when delivering a formal presentation to a large audience.\nIt can be equally nerve-racking to address a few colleagues in a meeting or to wait your turn to introduce yourself at a networking event. Even children waiting to be called upon by the teacher to answer a question can find it intimidating.\nThat feeling of anxiety can strike any time we have to speak in front of others.\nHow to control your nerves Here are some practical tips to help you control and minimise your nerves:\nDrink water beforehand to avoid a dry mouth. Get your body moving before your presentation. It’s good to get out for a walk. Anxiety causes a lot of excess energy to flow through your body and you want to get that energy out. Movement is a great way to do so. Take a few deep breaths from your belly (not your chest). Breathe in through your nose for four seconds (while pushing your belly out); breathe out through your mouth for six seconds (while pushing your belly back in). It works better if you can make the breaths out longer than the breaths in. Chest breathing is what we do when we panic or when we’re doing sport. If you want to relax you need to learn to breathe from your belly. Develop a quick warm-up routine which you can repeat before any important presentation. Try and put together a combination of breathing, muscle relaxation and vocal exercises. There’s plenty of information available online about warm-up exercises. I worked with Toby Trimble, the MD and Founder of Trimble Productions. His company develops world-class educational programmes for thought-leaders in the veterinary industry. Before he presented at an important event we did some warm-ups together. Toby said that he felt far more relaxed and confident in his ability to be a great presenter, not just a good one. Interact with your audience right from the start. Ask them a question or invite them to work on a quick exercise. You could ask them to reflect on an idea and share their answer with the person sitting next to them. This moves the attention away from you and buys you some more time to relax during those first few minutes. It also means that you create an enjoyable experience from the start by making a good connection with your audience. The importance of rehearsal The above tips will all help to calm your nerves before a presentation. However, another highly effective way to reduce anxiety is to ensure you’re properly rehearsed. I’ve looked at the importance of rehearsal in a previous article.\nThe best way to control your nerves is to know what you’re talking about. As counterintuitive as it may sound, the more you rehearse the more spontaneous you’ll appear. And the more spontaneous you’ll appear, the more confident you’ll be. I recommend that everyone rehearses their presentation, replicating the situation you’ll face as closely as possible, at least three times.\nFacing your public speaking fears Alexandra Galviz has been named LinkedIn Top Voice UK twice and has become an official LinkedIn Learning Instructor. She’s best known for blogging under the hashtag #AuthenticAlex where she smashes one stigma at a time. Alex is also the co-creator of #LinkedInLocal, the biggest hashtag campaign on LinkedIn that created an offline community and scaled it in over 100 countries and 1,000 cities.\nWhen I interviewed Alex for the Ideas on Stage podcast she told me that she was terrified of speaking in public at the start of her career. It was one aspect of her job which she hated the most.\nAt some point she was offered two jobs from two different companies. One role didn’t involve public speaking but the other did. What did she do? She deliberately chose the one that required lots of public speaking so she would have to face her worst fears.\nIt’s an important lesson. The worst thing you can do is shy away from public speaking just because you get nervous. It’s far better to keep presenting despite the inevitable anxiety. That way you’ll learn to control and minimise the fear and become increasingly comfortable with it.\nIf you make the decision to keep presenting despite the nerves, you’ll get to a point where you can control your nerves much more easily. Don’t be too hard on yourself along the way. There will be ups and downs. Guy Kawasaki, one of Apple’s early employees and a legendary marketeer, says it took him twenty years to get comfortable with public speaking. Now he is world-renowned as a great public speaker.\nSummary Most people get nervous before public speaking. It’s a natural response to standing in front of lots of eyes staring back at us. There are lots of helpful strategies to manage your nerves. Develop a regular warm-up routine which will help you relax. Interact with the audience immediately to take the spotlight away from you.\nAccept that the nerves may never go away completely. The worst thing you can do is avoid public speaking. Put yourself forward for public speaking opportunities because it will get easier the more you do it—and your career and business will benefit.\nF﻿eedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

People are taking what ideas they think they know from Personal Branding and applying them with gusto. Others are doing it instinctively. One thing is for sure: it’s here to stay and remains a key tool to get ahead in the landscape of opportunity. Well, we all know what a brand is, and businesses promote their own brands, but artists and influencers promote their own personal brands. In 2022 we’re all expected to do it to win hearts, minds and gain traction. So, to break it down in my view, Personal Branding is on one hand your reputation, what people think of you, how they interact with you and what they say about you and on the other hand, what you project about yourself, the communication of your visual, moral and intellectual authenticity to the wider world via articles, videos, posts, Instagram visuals, tweets, Facebook stories and more importantly how you occupy your space on every stage, in every corridor, every meeting room and at every dinner table. There are however degrees by which we can share our authenticity. The brand we share to the wider world is different from the brand we share with our peers, different again with our family members and critically with oneself (bear with me here, I would argue the right authenticity starts with an honest relationship with oneself). Firstly let’s talk about reputation. One hears a lot the expression ‘Brand or be Branded’. This is the inevitable trace of our own reputations which follow us everywhere and more critically on the platforms of social media and search engines. Whether you do anything or not you have a brand. Simply by being present online, appearing in search results and having a couple of social media accounts, people have a perception of you. How we’re perceived and the effort we put into influencing that perception matter greatly. We also receive interaction from others on the grounds of our own likeability and capacity for giving service. I would argue that one’s behavior towards others is now held acutely accountable by our online and offline presence. LinkedIn is a prime example of this which requires both a delicate balance of increasing one’s own visibility and service-giving in order to succeed with it. The different strategies vary greatly from culture to culture but people ultimately need time to get to know you and trust you. Offering service without the hard sales follow-up seems the favorable way these days to win hearts and minds. Peers (even competitors) can become our greatest allies once we build trust and a strong personal brand. Now let’s talk about what you project about yourself. This is the power that we have to make a difference to our reputation. Our image, what we have to say to the world and what we stand for. A big challenge in 2022 is that we are now expected to brand ourselves not only on a professional level but also personally. That means what we’re sharing on Instagram needs more crafting, the 15 second TikTok videos we put together need more ideas, and even dating apps demand it! Everything has become a pitch! To advance ourselves using communication there are key tools at our disposal. Articles and blogs which garner and attract readership, a well-crafted visual image, what we wear, the work we put in to it that gets us attention, videos that communicate our personality and charisma, a rapidly firing Twitter account that keeps feeding the feed like popping corn. But what about those around us? Our clients, our colleagues, our peers and our prospects? Communication via our soft skills is key. The experience needs to be as effective ‘live’ as it is remotely and this is work, a lot of work. The key here is good old-fashioned personal development. Working on one’s self, sleep, exercise, the right foods, hobbies and passions (whatever floats your boat). This is all part of a creating a more attractive personal brand for those around us. Either way, one important thing is having an objective, what we want to achieve and deciding who our audience is to endorse us. That’s where our tools at Ideas on Stage are very useful. Because business is a pitch and life is a pitch. There’s just one word I mentioned earlier that I want to revisit. Authenticity. Authenticity is something that we are more and more encouraged to share. I would just say the context dictates that. We are still driving in mainly two personal branding lanes. Mixing it is the realm of stars. To give you my example on one hand my brand as a coach is business orientated, my photos and videos are relatively corporate and I communicate that I am very passionate about business communication. I have a wide skill set developed over years and people want to work with me…\nOn the other, my personal brand to my friends is that of a musician, painter and novice dancer. I post regularly to an audience of friends the highlights as they come. They are a tiny adorable following, some whom I have known for many years. I think most of us have this. But I do believe there are things we can carry over from our intimate personal brand to our public personal brand which makes for a unique and authentic image. The question is what works? So get working, it only works if you work it!\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/09/20/2022-09-20-what_the_hell_is_personal_branding_anyway/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What the hell is personal branding anyway?"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":" When you watch the best athletes their movement seems completely natural and effortless. The reason they look so at ease is because of the years of dedicated practice they’ve put in. No one is born with the ability to excel—it requires work.\nThe same is true for business presentations. It’s impossible to deliver a great speech without rehearsing it thoroughly. You can spot a presenter who hasn’t rehearsed adequately. The giveaways are that they might:\nFail to appear spontaneous Fail to deliver a presentation which flows in a natural or smooth way Use lots of verbal fillers—phrases like ‘you know’, ‘like’, ‘actually’, ‘um’, ‘ah’, ‘er’, etc. Fail to own the message Seem unprepared Sometimes panic before or during the presentation The Value of Rehearsing Rehearsing provides the opportunity to counter all those negative traits. The more times you can run through a presentation, the more freedom you’ll have to look spontaneous and deliver your message effortlessly. Rehearsals will help you become a more confident presenter, own your message, enjoy the moment and focus on the audience. All those finer delivery skills like eye contact, body language and use of voice can only come if you rehearse.\nIf you can’t deliver your speech effectively it’s like having a Tesla in Ludicrous Mode (which gives it supercar performance of 0-60 mph in less than three seconds) without knowing how to drive. It makes no sense.\nDo You Rehearse? When I ask this question during my coaching and training sessions, most people tell me they do. When I probe deeper, it becomes clear they don’t, because they don’t really understand what proper rehearsal is.\nMost conscientious people who have an important presentation coming up will put effort into thinking about what to say. They’ll go over the structure in their head. They might even flick through their deck, thinking about what to say for each slide.\nThis is not rehearsing. This is valuable preparation which will help. But it’s not enough to get you to the level you want.\nProper rehearsals mean delivering your presentation out loud as closely to the real situation as possible. It means speaking all of the words from beginning to end without stopping, as if there’s a real audience.\nThe closer the rehearsal can be at simulating the environment or conditions you’ll face the better.\nFor an online presentation, launch the conferencing software you’ll use, share your screen, and go through your material as if you’re presenting to a real audience.\nIf it will be an in-person presentation to six people, place six chairs in front of you or stick six Post-it Notes on the wall to practise eye contact with.\nIf you can rehearse in front of a mock audience of colleagues or friends that is ideal. This creates more pressure compared to rehearsing on your own.\nResearch has shown that the more pressure you can place yourself under during rehearsal the better the real presentation will go. The famous saying ‘practice makes perfect’ is not entirely true. Practice only makes perfect if you do it properly. A good example of meticulous rehearsal is the work Mark Leruste, the CEO and Founder of the Ministry of Purpose and the host of the award-winning podcast The Unconventionalists, put into his TEDx talk What They Don’t Tell You About Entrepreneurship.\nI interviewed Mark for the Ideas on Stage podcast and he shared the behind-the-scenes preparation which had gone into his TEDx talk (watch from 00:40 to 05:04).\nMark told me how he had worked on the content for the talk for months, losing sleep and stressing about it—at the same time as starting a family and founding a new business.\nHowever, with just three weeks to go, Mark committed to testing the speech to 21 friends over 21 days in 21 different locations across London.\nHe said it was one of the most challenging experiences as a speaker. Much of the feedback was awkward and difficult to hear but also very useful.\nWith just a few days to go before stepping on stage in front of a live crowd one friend admitted he felt the speech was ‘boring’. Mark told the friend an alternative idea and decided to scrap everything he had been working on for five months and start afresh.\nThe result was a fantastic talk which clocked up more than one million views and became the most watched TEDxCardiff talk to date. It shows why rehearsing in front of someone is so important. Without that honest feedback from his friends, Mark would never have made such fundamental and important changes which ultimately made for a great experience for his audience.\nHow much rehearsal should I do? There’s no magic number as to how many times you should rehearse in preparation for a typical business presentation. Based on my personal experience and from working with our clients I would say three times is the minimum. For some people that’s enough. Others will benefit from further rehearsal.\nIt’s also important to space out your rehearsals. Don’t cram them all into the last minute and do them consecutively. If I had two weeks before an event I would push myself to do five rehearsals equally spaced over that time. Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who did pioneering research into memory, published a detailed study in his 1885 book Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology.\nHe suggested that learning is more effective when we space out the sessions. We have a much better recall of information if we do that rather than cramming the study into one day.\nThat advice applies just as much to rehearsing for a presentation as it does to revising for an exam.\nRehearse Beyond Robotic I often hear business leaders worrying that rehearsing will make their presentation appear robotic. The only time that will happen is if you haven’t rehearsed enough.\nIn TED Talks, Chris Anderson says that rehearsing is like climbing a mountain. If you start your climb but stop immediately, you’ll never get to the top. If you only rehearse once or twice for a presentation and stop, you’ll appear robotic. You need to keep climbing to get to the summit and reach the point where you’ve internalised your message.\nThis is distinct from trying to memorise a presentation word for word. That works for some people but in most cases it’s not necessary. What is important is to internalise your content. You need to know exactly what to say, what the key messages are and what the structure is. That’s when you’ll be confident in your ability to deliver a great presentation. The more you rehearse, the more confident you’ll be. Stop at the point you know the material well enough to be able to deliver it without any aids.\nMaking the time to rehearse A common fear is that people don’t have the time to rehearse, especially when faced with limited time to prepare for a big presentation.\nInstead of spending extra time tweaking slides or worrying over every exact word, invest time into rehearsing. It will pay off.\nAs Lee Warren says in The Busy Person\u0026rsquo;s Guide To Great Presenting, when you think about rehearsing, you only have two options: you either rehearse before a presentation or you rehearse in front of the audience. In other words, if you haven’t rehearsed in advance, your presentation will just be a rehearsal for what could have been.\nSummary Any great presenter will rehearse many times before you see them appear to deliver a brilliant performance. Time spent rehearsing a presentation is never wasted. Being properly rehearsed allows you to relax and enjoy the presentation. It allows you to focus on your delivery and the audience.\nRehearsal is not the same thing as preparation. A proper rehearsal is when you deliver the actual presentation in a situation which is as close to the real event as possible.\nI recommend that everyone rehearses a presentation at least three times, spacing out the rehearsals over the time available.\nThe more rehearsals you can do the more confident you’ll be—and the better your presentation will be.\nFeedback If this article resonates with you and has helped you, feel free to offer some feedback.

Some big firms are having difficulty forcing people back into the office, but one thing everyone seems to agree on is that Zoom is no substitute for face-to-face conferences or conventions.\nPresenters are now having to face a problem they haven’t faced for some time: how to make presentations interactive in front of big audiences, without the benefit of online features like polls, chat or breakout rooms. And this is all the more important since if anything, our attention spans (read: our tolerance for boredom and mediocrity) dropped since 2020.\nSo how can you bring your audience into an on-stage keynote when there are several hundred of them, and just you on stage? Luckily, we’ve been doing this for twelve years with TED(x) talks and business conferences, so here are some ideas we’ve tried and tested.\nHere are six ideas.\n1/ Poll them\nThis is a very simple technique, easy to accomplish, but it does require some thought. You can ask the audience a simple binary question (e.g. yes or no), and invite them to answer physically, for example by standing up or putting their hand in the air. The key is to ensure you are ready with a suitable reaction for any situation, because you may end up with many hands, or few, or none at all.\nYou can also ask several questions in a row to help to drive home a point. For example:\n“I’d like everyone who can to please stand up. Now, if you have never suffered Death By PowerPoint, you can sit down.” (Usually, very few will sit down at this point.)\n“Stay standing. Now, you can sit down if you have never inflicted Death By PowerPoint on an audience.” (Again, probably fairly few will sit down. You can make a remark like: “I admire your honesty, and frankly, I know I’ve done it before too.”)\n“Now, you can sit down if you’d like to hear about the antidote to Death By PowerPoint.”\nAt this point, almost everyone will sit down, and they will be listening carefully because you have made them express physically that they are open to what you’re going to say to them. If anyone remains standing, you can then make a funny comment, like: “For those still standing, you might be in the wrong amphitheater: the class on Managing Like It’s 1995 is down the hall. But by all means take your seats and stay!”\n2/ Make them move\nGetting people to stand up just to vote is one thing, but you can also ask them to move simply to get their juices flowing and wake up their minds. I remember a particularly memorable occasion when my colleague Rose Bloomfield realised that a prior speaker had bored the audience intensely, so right at the start of her talk, she asked everybody to stand up, stretch their hands upwards, and breathe deeply a few times. As a member of that audience, I felt not only energised, but grateful for the opportunity to stretch and wake up a little. It isn’t natural for humans to sit still for a long time, especially when bored.\n3/ Make them exchange\nAnother possibility is to ask the audience to pair up and chat with the person next to them. The key here is to delimit the subject clearly so their conversation does not take too long, otherwise you will end up stopping them while they are in full flow, and they may resent that.\nFor example, it could be a simple “get to know you” question, such as where you last went on holiday, or who is your favorite presenter, or your current favorite TV show. Or you could ask them to share something related to your subject. If you’re speaking about microfinance, you might ask them to guess the percentage of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Then you can tell them the answer, and ask the one in each pair who was closest to stand up. This is a fun, interactive way to reset their attention, and make them remember this important statistic or fact.\n4/ Make them think\nInteracting with an audience does not always involve them doing something. You can bring them into your talk by speaking about them, asking rhetorical questions like: “Have you ever…?” knowing that many of them will have had such an experience, but without expecting them to answer. These rhetorical questions will make them think, and draw them into what you are saying, deepening your connection with them and theirs with you. You can achieve a similar effect with the powerful word: “Imagine…” 5/ Surprise them\nIn a board meeting, surprise is rarely a good thing. With a big audience, it can be your greatest friend. Recently, for example, we produced a business conference with a ‘secret agent’ theme, where right at the start the VP took to the stage in dark glasses, addressed them as if they were in a secret agent bootcamp, and then gave them a first task: to find their own pair of sunglasses, hidden somewhere in the room. Eventually someone thought to look under their chair, where (prior to their arrival) the organizers had carefully taped a pair of sunglasses, and then they all realized, found their own pair, and put them on. This was a fun way to start the conference, to bring everyone together, and to establish a theme for the whole event.\n6/ Take (or ask) questions\nIn general terms, the larger the audience, the fewer people want to ask questions! Also, you may find that among those who dare, there’s always one who takes the opportunity to deliver a monologue as soon as they receive the hand-mike, instead of asking a question. To avoid situations like these, we find that apps like Beekast are very powerful, allowing everyone to post questions anonymously if you enable that option, and allowing you as the speaker (or the Master of Ceremonies if you have one) to choose the best and most appropriate questions to answer.\nWe have also hacked the typical post-presentation Q\u0026amp;A in some conferences. In one, we used a kind of ball with a microphone inside, and the speaker would throw it into the audience, and whoever caught it had to ask a question. In another, we turned it around and had the speaker (the company President) ask the audience a question, and throw the ball-mike to them to get someone to answer it. Sometimes, as MC, I get down from the stage and point a mike at unsuspecting audience members, asking them a quick question, such as: “What was your favorite part of yesterday’s workshops?”\nWhichever way (or ways) you choose to build interaction with your audience and bring them into your presentation, it will be better than a simple monologue, and will make a much more lasting effect on the participants. Remember our first revolution: it’s not your presentation, it’s theirs, so find ways to make it an interesting, personalized experience for them.\nOf course, sometimes this takes a spark of creativity, and some experience of what works and what doesn’t work, and it’s hard to do this when you are neck-deep in your subject.

It warns against those who know something about a subject but not quite enough.\nWe should apply the same caution to those business owners and leaders who pitch their presentations above the audience’s heads. They forget how much they know about a subject and aim too high.\nIn Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, one of the best books I’ve ever read, they introduce the concept of the curse of knowledge. It’s such a good phrase. In the book they talk about our inability to take our minds back to a time before we accumulated knowledge.\nOnce you become an experienced business leader or entrepreneur you will have acquired expertise in your field. The problem is that you become so close to your chosen subject area it’s easy to lose sight of other people’s level of knowledge.\nThis can lead to a situation where we think what we’re communicating is simple, clear and engaging—but the audience finds it quite the opposite. The curse of knowledge is the number one problem in communication. Too much knowledge Cast your mind back to when you were a student at school or university. There was always a teacher or lecturer with a superb grasp of their subject who wasn’t very good at explaining it to the class. They were so deeply immersed in their specialist area they had lost perspective on how to teach it.\nWhat was the problem there? The curse of knowledge. In Made to Stick, the authors cite a Stanford University study known as Tappers and Listeners. In 1990, psychology student Elizabeth Newton asked a series of people to tap out rhythms to famous songs on a table. She invited another set of people to guess the songs.\nBefore the experiment started, the ‘tappers’ estimated that the ‘listeners’ would correctly guess the tunes 50 percent of the time. In fact, they identified the songs correctly just 2.5 percent of the time.\nWhy was that? The tappers had the songs in their head all the time and couldn’t understand how the listeners couldn’t identify them. But what the listeners heard might just as well have been Morse code.\nAs Chip and Dan Heath explain, once we know something, we find it hard to imagine not knowing it. That’s how it was for the tappers. They define it as the knowledge ‘cursing’ us. Even though we need to put ourselves in the shoes of someone without our knowledge, unless we make a conscious effort, we don’t even realise we have that extra information.\nThe same thing can happen when we’re faced with presenting an idea. We are in danger of being tappers who assume the audience will be able to recognise the tune. This is especially true when the subject matter is complex or technical.\nKnowledge is a common curse Once you’ve become familiar with the concept of the curse of knowledge you start to recognise it in different areas of life.\nToo many writers assume too much of their readers. Sellers don’t make enough effort to educate their buyers. Politicians fail to convey their policies and manifestos to voters.\nWhat I see all too often in the field of presenting and public speaking is the same mistake—an assumption of too much knowledge among the audience.\nIt’s an easy trap to fall into unless you apply some perspective.\nThink about what it\u0026rsquo;s like for a top athlete like Usain Bolt.\nHis coach Glen Mills is highly respected in the field of athletics. He has also coached world champion Yohan Blake and was the head coach for the Jamaican Olympics athletics team. But to look at him you wouldn’t know it.\nImagine if the pair of them decided to have a running race over 100 metres. Bolt is lined up in the blocks in one lane and his coach is crouched down in another. The starter fires the pistol and they are off.\nWho do you think wins the race? Even though Mills is a highly experienced athletics coach, who has spent most of his life down at the track, I’m pretty sure you would agree that Bolt wins the race. Every day of the week. Yet, Bolt wants Mills as a coach. Why? Because Bolt (like any other top performer) is wise enough to understand that there are things he doesn’t know. He can’t see outside his own perspective.\nMills may not be the best performer. He gave up sprinting at an early age and switched to coaching. Yet he has the ability to bring out the best in Bolt. Even a top performer like Bolt needs some reality check and some outside perspective to achieve his peak performance.\nThe same is true for all of us, no matter what standard we are. It’s impossible for us to see what we can’t see. It’s a universal truth.\nWhen it comes to delivering great presentations it’s always a good idea to look at things from a different perspective. It helps you to see things as others do, which makes you a better presenter.\nGaining a different perspective is how you break the curse of knowledge.\nReal life example In 2020 I worked with Diana Hudson who is Director of Creative Exchange UK, a social enterprise in the creative and cultural industries.\nDiana came to me because she had lost confidence in her own ability to deliver talks and training sessions as coherently as she would have liked. Like many people, she found the switch to video calls difficult during the Covid pandemic, after years of meeting in person. Diana felt she needed some structure and coherence with her presenting.\nWe worked on some systems and methods which she could apply to her work. She found that understanding the needs of the other person was a major breakthrough. It influenced the order in which she gave information, for example. Diana told me that she noticed she had become more effective at presenting when she was later called up to speak at a funeral. A number of people came up to her afterwards and said how professional she had been.\nNow that she has more structure in place, Diana says, “I feel much more in control. If I tried to improve on my own, I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere close to where I am today.”\nHow does this apply to me? Next time you have a presentation to deliver, take time to think carefully about how you’ll communicate your key messages. Are you assuming your audience has more knowledge than they do? What’s the correct level to pitch the talk so everyone can buy into what you’re saying?\nStop to consider whether your audience will know what you’re talking about. There’s nothing wrong with breaking things down to their simplest form. That’s good communication.\nA good way to avoid the curse of knowledge is to focus on concrete rather than abstract concepts. Introduce real examples which will bring your ideas to life. Tell stories to illustrate your key points.\nIn a previous article I’ve looked in detail at how to use stories to make your presentations more powerful. People remember anecdotes and examples far more easily than abstract concepts.\nTell stories and your audience will understand your ideas, remember them and act upon them. Summary Too many presenters fall into the trap of assuming their audience has more knowledge than they do. It’s an easy mistake to make. We all acquire expertise throughout our lives, following our own unique path through education and careers.\nBut when it comes to speaking to an audience, too much knowledge can be a dangerous thing. You can assume that your audience knows what you do.\nThis dilemma is known as the curse of knowledge and is the enemy of good communication.\nTo counter this, you must gain some external perspective to ground yourself back down. When preparing a presentation take time to think about your message and how to communicate it simply to an audience, pitching at the right level for them.\nCommunicating your ideas in a simple way is more likely to resonate with your audiences—which will make it easier for you to achieve your business goals.\nFeedback If you enjoyed this article, please contact me with feedback.

"},{"author":"Andrea Pacini","contents":" Right now there\u0026rsquo;s someone in the world having a great idea; their own lightbulb moment which could change the world.\nMany entrepreneurs, business owners and leaders assume that their ideas are the most important thing. They believe that their idea, whether that be a product, service, project or business, is all that matters. They focus on creating and working on their concepts without giving sufficient thought to articulating them.\nYour idea is worthless unless you can communicate it.\nFailing to communicate an idea properly runs the risk of it falling flat. If there’s no message around a product, it’s unlikely to resonate with the market.\nCommunicating an idea badly, or not at all, can only lead to missed business opportunities.\nCommunication leads to success Pitching, presenting and communicating are crucial skills that every entrepreneur and business leader should master. Communicating your ideas can help you transform your business and deliver success.\nThere are so many areas in which this is important, depending on what you hope to achieve.\nIf you want to make more sales, your presentation should convince your prospects to buy from you.\nIf you want your team to follow you, you need to get them excited to join you on your journey and deliver on your strategy.\nIf you want to generate business interest from speaking at an event, you need to deliver a powerful talk that people will act upon.\nBusiness success depends on the idea and the way the idea is communicated. Idea + Communication = Success Here’s a model for you to consider: How many times have you seen two similar ideas (or product and services) where one fails and the other succeeds? Business history is full of moments where one piece of technology triumphed over its rival. The ideas are often similar, but what differentiates them is the way they are communicated.\nLet me draw a parallel. In the startup scene, there’s often a debate around Idea vs Execution. Which of the two is more important? Any experienced founder or entrepreneur would tell you that execution is what matters.\nIn his book Anything You Want, Derek Sivers says, “Ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.”\nI believe that the way you communicate your idea is also a means to multiply its success. It can be a competitive advantage for your business. You can amplify your ideas if you communicate them effectively.\nSivers explains that we can think of it this way: A terrible idea equals -1 A good idea equals 10 A brilliant idea equals 20 From an execution perspective: No execution equals $1 Good execution equals $100,000 Brilliant execution equals $10,000,000. Sivers says that if you want to turn an idea into a business, you need to multiply the Idea and the Execution. So the most brilliant, groundbreaking idea with no execution is worth $20. The same idea with brilliant execution is worth $200,000,000.\nThe value of ideas in practice Let’s look at how this might work in the real world. If you have an idea for a book with the potential to transform people’s lives but never write it you can’t call yourself an author. You’ll miss out on the opportunity to bring about the change your book could have inspired.\nI give this example to reinforce my point: ideas are not enough. When you combine a breakthrough idea with brilliant execution, you win. The key is that communication must play a big part in your execution. It’s not the only element behind a successful idea, of course. There are other factors that contribute to the success of an idea. But the single most important element in business success is your ability to communicate your ideas. Tim Berry — ​​Founder and Chairman of Palo Alto Software and bplans.com — says that “A good idea is like a beautiful day. Everybody owns it. You use it or you don’t. Other people may make better use of it than you do.”\nPeople that make better use of an idea are those who invest time and energy to craft a compelling story around it.\nSome personal examples Two of my favourite brands are Allbirds and Huel. I’m a bit obsessed with them to be honest.\nAllbirds make sustainable shoes and clothing. ​​Their promise is that their products are as eco-friendly as possible, manufactured using only natural materials. The company is also a certified B Corporation which means it has the highest sustainability rating.\nThey also say their shoes are the world\u0026rsquo;s most comfortable shoes. Now, I don’t know if they are the world\u0026rsquo;s most comfortable shoes. They certainly feel comfortable to me. But it was their brand values which made me fall in love with them in the first place. Their three key messages, that they are sustainable, comfortable and with a simple design, hits a sweet spot for people like me. Not only do they have a great idea — they’ve been very effective at telling me about it.\nAs a result, I have four pairs of Allbirds — a pair for the winter, summer and somewhere in between, plus a pair for running.\nAllbirds was launched in 2016. By 2020 the company was already valued at $1.7 billion. They went from a small startup to a billion-dollar brand in four years.\nAnother brand I love is Huel — who make nutritionally complete food you can prepare in a matter of seconds. As a business owner, my schedule is hectic. But I care about my health and I don’t want my busy schedule to get in the way of my nutrition. Huel allows me to eat well even if I have no time or I can’t prepare an actual meal — so I can avoid having sandwiches and crisps for lunch.\nHuel is another great example of a company that had a great idea who also focused on how to communicate it in a powerful way. Their communication reaches people who are looking for a product that’s affordable, approved by experts and environmentally friendly. To date, at the time of writing, Huel has sold over 200 million meals in more than 100 countries.\nI’m not saying the idea isn’t important. Of course not. Without an idea there would be no product. In my two examples of Allbirds and Huel their products are great. However, in both sectors, across footwear and nutrition, there are other alternatives. There may be rival products which are technically better. But in both cases the way they’ve communicated their ideas has touched me and I have no reason to look for replacements. Allbirds and Huel both understand that having a great product is not enough. They invest considerable time, energy and money on making sure their story, values and messages resonate with me. Summary Even the best ideas are worthless unless you can communicate them. Success in business depends on how well you can pitch, present and communicate an idea.\nThe best entrepreneurs and business leaders know this and value communication above ideas.\nIf you only focus your time and energy on the idea, you miss out on the opportunity to amplify your idea and allow it to resonate with an audience.\nCommunicating an idea effectively can give it exponential power. Considering what you want an audience to do, feel and know about your idea will help you achieve more sales, higher income and a better profile.\nFeedback If any of the points in this article have helped your business, please let me know.

Many people loved it. But he was criticised for not giving the audience what they wanted — which was the hits.\nNo doubt Sir Paul had his reasons. He doesn’t just want to play Beatles songs all evening. But even someone of his experience and talent can get it wrong sometimes. It’s an easy mistake to make. I see lots of business leaders giving presentations with messages which are not relevant to their audience. As a result, the people on the receiving end don’t react the way the speaker wants them to. They don’t believe, feel or do what the presenter hoped. The audience doesn\u0026rsquo;t take action. To explain why this happens, let me ask you a question. If you had to give a presentation in a few weeks’ time, what would be the first thing you would start working on? Don’t tell me what you should be doing. Be honest and think about what you would actually do.\nFor many entrepreneurs, business leaders and professionals the first thing they do is boot up their laptop, open PowerPoint (or another presentation tool like Apple’s Keynote) and start working on a deck.\nOthers might stop to think about their message, the agenda or the outline. That would be a better approach. However, even that isn’t the first thing you should do.\nThe very first step you should take is to think about the audience. When you give a presentation to an audience, it’s their presentation, not yours. It’s always the audience’s presentation.\nI like to think of a presentation as a present. If I go to buy you a present, it’s your present not mine, so I know I must buy something you like. When you give people a presentation, it’s their presentation not yours. So you need to reflect on your audience before you open PowerPoint and also before you start thinking about your message. Putting the audience-first approach into practice It’s all very well saying to put the audience first. But how can you do that in practice? When we work with clients we have an easy way of going about it. We always start with the ABC of preparation. ABC stands for Audience, Burning needs, Context. Before you do anything else, you need to take some time and ask yourself some questions about these three areas.\nMy colleague Phil Waknell has an excellent and more detailed summary of the sorts of questions you might want to consider in his book Business Presentation Revolution. However, here’s a summary of some of the most important questions.\nAudience\nWho are the key people in the audience? Which company do they work for? What are their job titles? Burning needs\nWhat are their main questions and challenges? How do their questions and challenges relate to your presentation? What do they expect from your presentation? Context\nHow long should the presentation be? How many people will you be presenting to? In what kind of room will your presentation take place? If it’s online, what conferencing tool are you going to use? Phil shares a great story in Business Presentation Revolution that illustrates the importance of putting the audience first.\nHe recalls a woman called Marie who was invited by a business association in Poland to give a talk about leadership. It was one of her first international speaking opportunities, so she worked really hard on her preparation, thinking about her messaging and designing some great slides.\nMarie arrived the day before the conference and then went to the venue 30 minutes before the start of her presentation so she had some time to set things up. When she was about to connect her laptop to the screen, she realised there was no screen. She called the hotel facilities manager for support. Rather than helping her out, the manager started laughing.\nIt turned out that the talk was for an association of blind professionals so there was no need for a screen.\nIt sounds like a bad joke but it’s a true example. Marie had done all her preparation except the crucial audience research. It wouldn’t have taken her long to establish that the audience would all be blind.\nMarie’s story underlines the need to relate your presentation to your audience and work through the ABC.\nWhat if I don’t have all the answers? It’s not always possible to know everything about your audience. You might be able to make some assumptions, based on your industry experience. But there might be gaps in your knowledge about the audience, their burning needs and the context. However, the more you can get to know your audience in advance, the more solid your assumptions will be. Not all of the questions will be relevant each time you start to prepare a presentation. But the process of running through them, researching as much as you can and thinking about the audience’s needs and the setting is always time well spent. The answers to the questions will help you to develop a message which is relevant and useful for the listeners. It’s impossible to create a presentation which is related to your audience unless you start with the ABC. Summary A common mistake people make when delivering presentations is not thinking enough about the audience.\nMany business leaders start preparing for a presentation by working on their PowerPoint slides or working on the message.\nThe best action to take before anything else is to think about your audience and do some research.\nYou can do this by following the ABC — Audience, Burning needs and Context.\nWhen you communicate a message which is related to your audience, they will believe, feel and do what you want them to. They will take action. Feedback My hope when writing these articles is that business leaders will put the advice into action and improve their presentations.

Facts and figures are hard to remember but we love hearing anecdotes.\nMany business owners, leaders and professionals make the mistake of only sharing information in their presentations. They include abstract concepts, facts and figures. As a result, their presentations remain dry, factual and boring. You don’t want to be a boring presenter. As Dr John Medina says in his brilliant book Brain Rules, “the brain doesn’t pay attention to boring things.” In a previous article I explored how to simplify your presentations, to ensure that you keep your message, your visuals and your delivery as simple as possible.\nAnother technique I looked at was how to use the Rule of Three to present a clear message.\nTo take your presentation to the next level, you should also make your presentations Original and Enjoyable — two further principles from the Presentation SCORE method. Let’s look at how to spice things and add some colour.\nLet me tell you a story If you have an important message you want to communicate, ask yourself, “Is there a story I can tell to illustrate my point?”\nIn the context of a business presentation a story could be a personal anecdote about yourself or someone else, a real-life example, a case study or a tale about a client\u0026rsquo;s success.\nIn my experience, most business presentations are made up of 99 percent facts and, if you are lucky, 1 percent story. To me that’s often the wrong way round. It’s sometimes better to flip it and spend more of your time sharing examples.\nIn his book Lend Me Your Ears, Professor Max Atkinson describes a study he made of audience reactions to presentations. He positioned one camera on the speaker and the other on the audience. The study found that whenever a speaker used the phrase ‘for example’ it grabbed people’s attention. They tended to lift their heads or eyes in anticipation of what was to come.\nWith that in mind, tell more stories! This is one of the most powerful ways to make your presentations more original and enjoyable. Storytelling examples Here are some examples where storytelling has helped some of the clients we’ve worked with at Ideas on Stage.\nEach of these examples shows how a story can bring a message to life. The audience is much more likely to remember examples over abstract information. People will remember the story and the message. Storytelling is not about telling a story for the sake of it. It’s about telling a story to illustrate a particular point. Susanna Lawson — Founder of OneFile In 2021 I worked with Susanna on a presentation about women’s confidence. She decided to include a personal story about her own experience. Susanna told how she founded the apprenticeship software company OneFile with her husband. They delayed starting a family while they focused on the business. Aged 29, when the company had grown, they had their first son and Susanna took a year off on maternity leave.\nBy the time she returned to work the company had doubled in size from nine to 19 employees.\nShe said: “Before having our baby I wasn’t really maternal. I told the team I would be back in a couple of months. But once he came I knew I needed to be off for longer and we agreed I would take a year. In that year OneFile doubled in size because it coincided with massive improvements in technology.\n“I initially came back to work part time. After a couple of weeks I overheard a couple of the new team members. One of them asked, ‘So who is she then?’ and the other replied ‘Oh, she is the boss’ wife’.\n“I was absolutely devastated. I felt like I had been punched in the stomach. I wasn’t the boss’ wife — I was the boss! But they just didn’t see me as that! My confidence was in tatters. I have very rarely cried at work but this was one of those times.”\nThe story was an extremely powerful and personal way to explain her own relationship with confidence to her audience.\nNishita Dewan — Director at CollaborateHQ\nTEDx invited Nishita to talk about The Magic of Unlikely Alliances. She approached me to help ensure she was fully prepared to give a fantastic presentation. She wanted to nudge everyone to form diverse collaborations and to harness the potential of diversity of thought.\nNishita discussed an unlikely collaboration between Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and the Ferrari Formula 1 race team.\nShe referenced a story about a couple of doctors from GOSH sharing their frustrations at the high error rates when transferring critically ill infants from the operating theatre to the intensive care unit.\nNishita recalled that as they were having lunch, they shifted their attention to the TV, which was showing the Formula 1 race. By pure serendipity, they observed the moment the Ferrari team completed a pit stop in under 7 seconds. They observed the precision and teamwork from a team of pit crew technicians—working together to optimise the car for the track—and in that moment, they realised the uncanny similarity between the pit stop and their handover process. So the doctors and their team travelled to the Ferrari HQ in Italy to learn more about this handover process. From this transfer of knowledge, the doctors designed a new handover protocol with more sophisticated procedures and better coordinated teamwork. As a result, they achieved a 20 percent improvement in patient safety, saving childrens’ lives.\nDiana Hudson — Director of the social enterprise Creative Exchange UK\nThe two stories above are about the presenter themselves in Susanna’s case and about somebody else in Nishita’s presentation. Not all stories have to be so in depth. Sometimes giving a quick example is all you need.\nI worked with Diana Hudson to prepare a presentation on the topic of Circular Economy. She felt the audience didn’t have much knowledge on the subject, so she included two examples to explain what the circular economy is.\nDiana said: “MUD Jeans is a company that specialises in renting jeans. As a client, you can pay a subscription to own a pair of jeans for some time and then exchange them for a different pair as your needs or requirements change. “Another great example is Food Float, a not-for-profit that provides local, fresh food to people in and around Dorking in the UK. They gather together local food producers and sell their products within the community. This minimises costs, packaging, miles and puts money back into the community.”\nDiana’s choice of Food Float was excellent because it was relevant both to her audience and her message. Her presentation was for an audience in Dorking. The choice of a local example meant something to her audience — and also helped to explain what the circular economy is. What stories can you tell? The examples above provide some insight into how stories can help to bring a presentation to life. As you prepare your next presentation, think about some of the most important points you want to get across. Then ask yourself what story you can tell to illustrate your points.\nIf you only include information, facts and figures, they will touch the logical part of the brain. In basic terms, our brains are divided into two parts: the logical part and the emotional part. When you tell a story it touches the emotional part of the brain, which can be far more powerful.\nA good presentation must stimulate a mix of logical and emotional responses so you satisfy both areas of people’s brain. The exact proportion of that mix will be different for each audience, which will have its own unique requirements.\nThink of your presentation as a seesaw. A seesaw is parallel to the ground only when nobody is using it. As soon as two kids start playing with it, the seesaw starts going up and down. A seesaw parallel to the ground is equivalent to a presentation with an equal mix of logic and emotion. Depending on the context, you may want to shift the balance either towards your logical arguments or towards your emotional arguments.\nWhat you never want to do is have a presentation that relies on logic alone.\nSummary We’re wired to receive facts and figures in the logical part of our brain. Touching the emotional part with stories, anecdotes and examples is far more powerful.\nIf you can bring your presentations to life with stories they will have more impact on your audience.\nStories can be anything which provides a real life context to your message. Think about what anecdotes, examples and case studies you can tell the audience which fit with your narrative.\nThe relative weight of facts versus stories is up to you. But I would recommend not relying on facts alone if you want to keep your message original and enjoyable. Feedback I love to hear from people who have read my articles and improved their presentations.

You’re losing the audience (which might be clients, colleagues, the board, partners or investors).\nIf so, you are not alone. Most business leaders and professionals struggle with this.\nFortunately, there is one simple yet powerful communication technique that will help you: the Rule of Three.\nThe Rule of Three Three is the most powerful number in communication. An audience is far more likely to remember information if it’s presented in groups of threes.\nIf you give your audience one piece of information, they will feel it’s not enough. If you offer more than three they may find that overwhelming.\nHarvard Professor George Miller published a paper in 1956 called The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two. He argued at the time that we struggle to retain more than seven or nine digits.\nMore recent scientific research brings that figure down to three or four pieces of information.\nThe advert which launched the original BBC Three channel featured a song by Bob Durough in which he sings: “Three is a magic number”. There is something so right about things that come in threes. They are effective and satisfying.\nThree in Everyday Life Threes are deeply embedded in our culture as easy ways to remember things. Once you realise it you’ll notice threes everywhere.\nGood stories have a beginning, middle and end\nMost plays have three acts\nFilms and books come in trilogies\nSome of the best marketing slogans use just three words\nJust Do It (Nike)\nI’m loving it (McDonald’s)\nEvery little helps (Tesco)\nTaste the difference (Sainsbury’s)\nThe UK government used the power of three for their Covid slogans\nStay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\nHands, Face, Space\nSome of the most powerful political statements use three\nLiberté, Égalité, Fraternité (the national motto of France)\nLife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (the well-known phrase from the United States’ Declaration of Independence)\nGovernment of the people, by the people, for the people (Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address)\nOur priorities are Education, Education, Education (Tony Blair)\nFairy tales often use three for maximum impact\nThe Three Musketeers\nThe Three Little Pigs\nMany businesses use a three-tier pricing structure. You often come across bronze, silver and gold price points or service levels. It’s no coincidence that we use the same system for first, second and third in sporting events. No one cares who came fourth.\nThe rule of three is often used to great effect in comedy. Comedies often have three characters (like the old Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman routines). The first two examples are sensible and the third is ridiculous.\nUsing three words or three phrases for maximum impact appears in all sorts of other areas of life. Here are some other famous examples:\nReady, steady, go\nThe truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\nSex, drugs \u0026amp; rock n\u0026rsquo; roll\nSee it, say it, sorted (British Transport Police)\nApplying the Rule of Three to Presentations Next time you prepare a presentation, try applying the Rule of Three. Break down your structure into three parts.\nAt Ideas on Stage we’ve worked with thousands of clients since 2010 and I’ve never seen a presentation that can’t be divided into three parts.\nIf you aren’t doing this, and paying attention to the way you structure your presentations, you’re making it unnecessarily difficult for your audience to follow you, remember what you say, and take action.\nTo help you understand how you can apply the magic number three to your presentations, here are some examples I’ve come across in a business context. Feel free to adapt these for your own use.\nThe three priorities we’ll use to achieve the sales target for the next quarter Three reasons to buy your product or service Problem, Solution, Call to action Three benefits to your solution Three reasons why the board should approve the budget for your project Three reasons to hire you Context, Actions, Results Three reasons to invest in your startup Sticking to Three People often push back about the Rule of Three and tell me they have more than three points to share during a presentation. How can they possibly stick to three points?\nIf you’re thinking the same, ask yourself the following:\nDo you really need to include everything? Are those nine points of equal importance? Of course not. Often, it’s better to explain three things that someone will comprehend rather than overwhelming them with too much information. Remember, if everything is important, nothing is important. If there really are nine important points, can they be grouped into three sections? Perhaps there are patterns and points of connection? Try combining certain elements so you can still stick to the Rule of Three. Putting it into Practice Alan Furley is the Co-Founder and CEO of ISL Talent, an award-winning UK Recruitment Consultancy. They work as a talent partner to startups and scaleups to help them build strong teams.\nWe worked with Alan to help him create a presentation for prospects on the following topic: How To Get Your First 10 Hires Right.\nAlan broke the one-hour presentation down into three key messages which had some supporting points (also broken down into threes).\nKey message 1: If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail\nSpend time planning before jumping into hiring A clear process for your next hire The power of an Org Chart Key message 2: Treat your employees like you treat customers\nStand out to people who aren’t looking for a job Think about them not you Purpose, team and values in hiring Key message 3: Think retention first, recruitment second\nHire potential vs credentials Capturing your values Have a retention plan The beauty of this technique is that it works all the time. Regardless of how long your presentation is — 5 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour — you can always structure your content into three parts.\nI use the Rule of Three myself when I’m running group workshops for our clients. The course comprises five online sessions of three hours each. I like to structure the whole workshop into three parts across those 15 hours like this:\nHow to craft a captivating message How to reinforce your message with powerful visuals How to deliver your message with confidence The Rule of Three in Real Life In 2007 an academic paper titled The rule of three: How the third event signals the emergence of a streak examined people’s perception of ‘streaks’ in stock market movement and sports victories.\nWhen something repeats three times we are most likely to see that as a ‘streak’. If it happens more often we don’t place any more importance on it.\nThe study asked students how much (theoretical) inheritance money they would invest in a stock. The students were prepared to put the most money into shares when they had risen in value over the three previous days. If the stock continued to rise it didn’t make them any more likely to invest.\nSimilarly, bookies and gamblers place greater weight on teams that have won three games in a row.\nThe study concluded that punters would be well advised to bet against teams that have won three games in a row and back teams that have lost three games in a row (in order to beat the market).\nSummary If you try to deliver too many points to your audience you will lose them along the way.\nOur brains are wired to find the Rule of Three particularly satisfying and we retain three pieces of information more easily than any other quantity.\nThe Rule of Three is widely deployed in literature, comedy and politics. It finds its way into all sorts of catchphrases and slogans.\nUsing the Rule of Three in your presentations is highly effective. Any presentation can be restructured to conform to three sections.\nEven if you have more points to make, still try to structure your presentation in three parts.\nFeedback If you enjoyed this article, I would love to hear from you.

The consequence is that the audience fails to grasp the message and will not take the desired action.\nI believe that the more you say, the less your audience will remember. So you need to keep your presentations short, simple and to the point.\nKeeping it simple is one of the five key factors behind any powerful presentation. If you are interested in learning more about the others, I have written about them here.\nIn 1996 Guinness released their slightly surreal ‘Fish on a Bicycle’ advert. It finished with the slogan “a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle” over a shot of a fish riding a bike.\nThat image has always stuck with me. The point is that fish do not need bicycles. And maybe women don’t need us men! It’s the same with your presentations. The audience doesn’t need everything you think they might.\nWhilst it might seem counterintuitive, taking away details from your presentation will make it stronger and more impactful.\nEliminate the unnecessary so the necessary can flourish. This will make it more likely that your audience will understand you, remember you, and act upon your ideas.\nSo how do you put all this into practice? Here are three tips to make your presentations simple yet effective.\nTip 1: Simplify Your Message At Ideas on Stage we previously worked with Luc Bretones, a former Executive Vice President at Orange. He once said: “I only remember one thing from a pitch, just tell me what I need to know.”\nOne thing.\nThink about your next presentation: what’s your one thing? If you were to summarise the core idea behind your next presentation in one message, what would you say?\nA useful exercise is to distil what you want to say down to 70 words (or to a 30-second pitch) using the following guidelines:\nWHAT: What exactly do you want to tell your audience? SO WHAT: Why should they care? WHAT NEXT: What action do you want the audience to take afterwards? If you cannot edit your message down to 70 words then your message is not simple enough.\nTip 2: Simplify Your Visuals Research shows that the information we receive orally has to compete for our attention with the information we receive in written form. In other words, people can’t read and listen at the same time. So it’s counterproductive to echo what you are saying in your slides.\nWith this in mind, keep your slides simple. One idea per slide is sufficient. There is no point creating slides which replicate what you are saying (especially if they are cluttered with bullet points).\nBillboard adverts rarely contain many words. The best are usually just a big image and a few words.\nTake the same ideas and adapt them for your slides. Instead of using lots of words, try these suggestions:\nShow an image or an icon that illustrates your point Combine an image with a few words Show just a few words or a big number Another way to think about it is to apply the three-second rule. Every time you show a slide, it should be so intuitive that your audience is able to understand the message in no more than three seconds.\nThink of your slides as visual aids to support, reinforce and amplify your message. You are the presentation, not your slides.\nTip 3: Simplify Your Delivery The next area to consider is the language you use. There are two golden rules:\nUse simple words Avoid verbal fillers Use simple words\nGreat communicators use simple words, simple sentences and simple language. Some professionals use complex language because they think it makes them sound smarter. They fall into the trap of using jargon and acronyms. They use long, confusing sentences.\nThe best presenters replace complex language with simple words. This doesn’t mean the ideas have to be simplistic. No one is suggesting you dumb down the ideas or the content. Just make the language simple.\nCarmine Gallo, one of the world’s top experts in communication, did an interesting exercise. He took Steve Jobs’ presentation when he launched the first iPhone in 2007 and passed the words through the Hemingway App (which analyses language). The first 1,000 words came back as language appropriate for third-grade students — who are aged 8 and 9.\nThat iPhone launch was considered a historic moment for Apple and is still remembered to this day. The technology he was launching was revolutionary but the language was simple.\nAvoid verbal fillers\nVerbal fillers, or filler words, are those phrases people throw in to buy themselves time. These are words and sounds like ‘you know’, ‘like’, ‘actually’, ‘um’, ‘ah’ and ‘er’.\nThese ‘unwords’ add zero meaning to your message and reduce your credibility. They make you look unprepared, uncomfortable and less credible.\nThere are two effective ways to eliminate verbal fillers from your vocabulary:\nAwareness. Work out whether you use verbal fillers and, if so, which ones. Try recording yourself and then count how many times you use filler words. Alternatively, work with a presentation coach who will pick up on this for you. Preparation. Once you are aware of your own verbal fillers, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse! The more you practise, the easier it will be. Putting Simplicity into Practice I previously worked with Jessie and Sebastian Wölke from NO PLANET B, an upcycling beauty brand that makes natural, vegan and microplastic-free cosmetics, with no animal testing.\nThey knew they were confident speakers but their presentations were too long and lacked focus. By their own admission, they used to spend hours tweaking slides on PowerPoint.\nAfter learning the tools and techniques to simplify their message and style, they revised their working methods. After introducing the new tactics, they said that things flowed better from the outset, it was easier to remember what they wanted to say and their ideas carried more weight.\nJessie and Sebastian later told me they had used the tools for two big presentations soon after we met. They were able to create more impactful messaging and visuals and improved their delivery which helped them to win new business.\nSummary The simpler you can make your presentation, the stronger and more impactful it will be.\nThere are three key areas to work on:\nSimplify your message. Start by summing up the key idea in 70 words or less. Simplify your visuals. Every slide should be digestible in three seconds. Don’t use lots of words. All you need is a key image and a few words. Simply your delivery. Use simple words and avoid verbal fillers. Feedback Please comment, get in touch or share the article with any colleagues or friends who might benefit from the ideas.

In not doing so they are making a fundamental mistake.\nSome think it’s primarily about creating slides on PowerPoint. They think if they get a decent deck together then they are good to go.\nIf you are one of those people who spend most of your preparation time working on PowerPoint slides (or any other presentation tool), you’ve missed the point. There is so much more to focus on than PowerPoint.\nWhat is far more important is your ability to pitch, present and communicate your ideas so you can achieve your objectives. The aim might be to win more deals, make more sales, inspire and motivate your team, increase your credibility or reputation — or make progress in your career.\nThink about it. There are so many other areas of life which require us to follow some clear principles — and we would never think to do otherwise.\nIf you wanted to learn how to play a new musical instrument, you would spend time working on fingering or breathing and learning scales.\nTo master a new sport you would need to know the rules of the game and the basic techniques. For racket sports and golf, for example, you would work on your swing. All of that is more important than having the latest equipment.\nWhy is it that if we want to learn or get better at presenting, we ignore the fundamental principles of communication?\nThose who ignore the fundamental principles will continue to deliver presentations that waste their own time and that of the audience. Plus, there will be no desired action from the audience and the objectives will not be achieved.\nPrinciples First; PowerPoint Last If you want your audience to take action and you want to use presentations to gain a competitive advantage in your business, you have to accept there are fundamental principles to follow. A presentation is so much more than PowerPoint.\nFocusing on the tool (PowerPoint) rather than the principles is like worrying about your mic before learning how to sing.\nJeff Bezos once said that he is often asked what will change in the next ten years, but rarely what is not going to change in the next ten years. He believes that it is the second question which is more important — and advises people to ‘focus on the things that don’t change.’\nIn the case of Amazon, Bezos realised that people will always want low prices, fast delivery and vast selection. There is a business opportunity in embracing what you know will remain constant.\nWith presentations we should take heed of Jeff Bezos’s observation and also focus on the things that don\u0026rsquo;t change. The tools and technology we use to communicate our ideas will change. Presentation software, like PowerPoint, will continue to advance. However, the fundamental principles of good presentations will never change.\nNo one is going to come up to you in ten years’ time and say, “Great presentation, I just wish it was more complex / I wish it was much longer / I wish the structure wasn’t that clear / I wish it wasn’t so relevant to me and my needs / I just wish it was more boring.”\nIf you follow the right principles consistently, you will become the presenter everyone remembers. Your presentations will give you a competitive advantage which will allow you to achieve your personal and professional objectives.\nThe Five Key Principles There are five principles for powerful presentations. Remember the word SCORE. Just like in football you want to SCORE when you give a presentation:\nSIMPLE: The more you say, the less they remember, so keep it short, simple and to the point.\nCLEAR: Your objectives and key messages should be obvious to everybody — including you.\nORIGINAL: Make your presentation stand out, and people will remember it for longer.\nRELATED: Think about your audience and relate everything back to them. Think of it as the audience’s presentation. Make it relevant and useful for your audience.\nENJOYABLE: If the audience enjoys your talk, they will pay more attention, remember more and take action.\nThe magic happens when you apply these five principles to each of the three key arts of presenting. The three arts are:\nYour message: what you say Your delivery: how you say it Your visuals: what you show when you say it Each of these (Message, Visuals and Delivery) can and should meet the five principles so that your presentations will be Simple, Clear, Original, Related and Enjoyable from any perspective.\nIf one of these three key elements is missing, you will find it hard to achieve your goals for the presentation. Think about how movies are put together. Any successful movie has a great plot (which is like the message), superb acting (which is the delivery) and stunning special effects or beautiful cinematography (the visuals). A movie which is lacking any of those elements will not be as enjoyable. The same is true for a presentation.\nI previously worked with Bryan MacMillan, the Founder and CEO of TyreRunner.com, which is a price comparison site for car tyres.\nAlthough Bryan is a naturally confident guy, being from a technical background, he had a tendency to be too detailed in his presentations. He admitted that he tended to jump straight into PowerPoint. When he delivered his presentations he often found that he was losing the audience’s interest.\nHe wanted to learn how to deliver an interactive presentation which would stand out, generate interest in his business and open the doors to new opportunities.\nWe helped Bryan to learn how to adopt a framework to put together a presentation which focused on his audience. He quickly realised that he needed to spend more time on idea creation and then editing down what he wanted to say.\nBryan’s feedback was that he felt far more confident after sticking to a framework. He is now regularly delivering great presentations with great confidence, drawing on his toolbox which gives him consistency.\nSeven Steps For Better Presentations How do you apply all this in practice? For your next presentation, here are seven steps you need to follow to be better prepared. If you follow these your presentations will improve dramatically.\nAnalyse your audience Your presentations must relate to your audience. Before opening up PowerPoint or thinking about your key messages, ask yourself some questions about your audience. What are their needs? What is the context of the presentation?\nDefine a clear objective What do you want your audience to believe, feel or do after your presentation? Tailor your presentation accordingly.\nBrainstorm to identify your key messages Forget about technology, go analogue: pen and paper, whiteboards, flipcharts.\nSimplify your message Your message needs to be simple for the audience to understand. What is the key message your audience really needs to take away from your presentation? Write it down in a maximum of 70 words.\nDevelop a clear storyline Translate the ideas from the previous brainstorming session into a storyline that makes it easy for the audience to follow you and remember what you say.\nMake it original and enjoyable Tell them stories. People remember examples and anecdotes far better than naked facts and figures.\nRehearse Rehearse a few times before the actual presentation and you’ll shine.\nFollow these steps consistently and you will become the best presenter you can be.\nRooted In Science A presentation is a mix of art and science. There has been lots of research into how an audience member’s brain works. Thanks to science we know something about how to keep an audiences’ attention and how to achieve high engagement and comprehension.\nScience can tell us what works and what doesn’t when we communicate our ideas.\nThe principles outlined in this article are rooted in what science tells us.\nIf you want to delve more deeply into the science behind presenting, I interviewed Dr John Medina (author of Brain Rules) on the Ideas on Stage podcast.\nSummary If you are one of those business leaders who fires up PowerPoint as the starting point for a presentation, you are making a mistake.\nYou can produce a much better presentation by employing some key principles in your preparation which you stick to each time.\nIt is far better to start with just a pen and paper and really think about your audience and what message you want to get across.\nThere are five key principles for any great presentation which you can remember with the word SCORE — keep it SIMPLE, make your messages CLEAR, make it ORIGINAL, keep it RELATED to your audience and make sure it is ENJOYABLE for them.\nApply those five principles to the three key arts of presenting — the MESSAGE, the VISUALS and the DELIVERY.\nBring everything back to the audience and what you want to achieve, brainstorm good ideas, simplify everything down — and then rehearse.\nOnce you have a system in place, use it every time to make better presentations, and you will achieve your personal and business goals.\nFeedback If this article has helped you please get in touch to let me know.

Perhaps they are born with confidence?\nOr they think that to become more confident at presenting they simply need to improve their delivery skills and work on things like eye contact, body language and vocal delivery. These things are all important but there is so much more to it.\nAs a result, most untrained business leaders don’t feel confident presenting at all.\nOver the years I’ve heard all sorts of reasons why people don’t like presenting. For example:\n“I don’t like to be the front man” “I get very nervous when presenting” “I have an internal panic before a presentation” “I hate webinars” “I’m petrified by the idea of having to sell something during a presentation” “Presenting makes me feel out of my comfort zone” Perhaps some of those thoughts have come into your head before a presentation?\nWell don’t worry. Everybody gets nervous, including me. It’s perfectly natural. We all have a moment of self-doubt and a rush of adrenaline before a presentation. Every presentation requires people to sell something – even if it’s themselves.\nSo how can you change your thinking and gain some genuine confidence? Let’s look at where confidence comes from.\nPeople Are Not Born With Confidence…It Grows Confidence is not something you either have or don’t have. It’s not something you search for. It’s something you develop. It comes from the actions you take and the choices you make.\nYour inherent ability to speak in public is not what gives confidence. It’s based on your belief that you can succeed at speaking in public.\nDon’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about blind self-belief. You can reinforce your beliefs (and your behaviours as a result) by taking consistent action. By taking small risks each time you present you will get better and better. That will allow real deep confidence in yourself to develop.\nIn 1986 Queen gave their monumental concert at Wembley Stadium in front of 72,000 people. It has gone down in rock music history as one of the greatest performances of all time.\nEven a band fronted by Freddie Mercury couldn’t have done that at the start of their career. Queen had been touring for over 15 years by that point. At one gig at Bedford College in 1972 they played to just six people.\nThe same process should apply to your presentations. You might not end up at Wembley Stadium but you can improve and build confidence with every presentation!\nThree Essential Ingredients For Confident Presenting If you want to become a confident presenter, who has absolute faith in your content and in your ability to deliver it, you need three things:\nThe ability to develop a simple and clear message It requires proper preparation to communicate ideas (which might be complex or technical) in a simple and clear way. There are practical principles to follow in order to:\nSimplify your message and make it relevant to the audience Develop a clear and engaging storyline that grabs the audience’s attention Deliver your message comfortably and convincingly If you do, your audience will be engaged, understand your message and take action.\nA proven process When you follow a proven process, you will naturally feel confident. At Ideas on Stage we recommend a five-step process which will help you to deliver effective presentations and build confidence. You can read more about the process here in a previous article. We encourage people to do some analysis of your audience, brainstorm ideas, create a storyline, map out your slides and then rehearse repeatedly. With the right process you will feel ready to connect with your audience and presenting becomes exciting.\nThe ability to use presentations to grab important opportunities You need to be specific and strategic about the steps you want your audience to take, following your presentation. With the right techniques, you can do that in a non-salesy and elegant way. If you apply this method you will make more sales, win more deals and grow your business. You also gain credibility as a leader and improve the image of your company.\nI previously worked with Ciaran O’Donnell who is a Finance Director for start-ups and early-stage businesses who had been named CFO of the Year at the British Accountancy Awards. Ciaran was already a good speaker but wanted to get more comfortable in front of larger audiences. He said he wanted to become more confident and polished and felt he was never going to nail this on his own.\nWe worked together for four weeks to equip him with tools which would allow him to take his presentation skills to the next level. The two areas we focused on were his ability to develop a captivating message and how to deliver his message comfortably and convincingly. During rehearsals we focused on what he needed to practise. Ciaran made very quick progress and his presentations became refreshing and disruptive.\nCiaran felt that he grew massively in confidence by becoming better organised. He learnt how to create a better message centred around the audience and had a much better plan in place.\nEverything came together really well for Ciaran. Seeing how quickly he had improved, it felt to him almost bizarre he was able to deliver a presentation of such a high standard.\nConfidence Can Be Learned Many leaders and professionals wish they were natural communicators and feel they should be. The fact is you don’t. Presenting is not a natural thing to do. Standing up in front of an audience (on stage or online) takes everyone outside their comfort zone. But you can develop your skills and your confidence to make it look natural.\nThe latest research into human development has shown that the brain can be rewired. We can learn new behaviour and change our thought patterns at any age. Even people with the greatest self doubt can build confidence if they are determined to do so.\nBy taking small steps, and pushing our boundaries to take risks we can grow in confidence.\nThe two things you can do to work on confidence are:\nTake any opportunity to practise your presentation skills The more you present, the better you get at it. It’s like learning how to play an instrument or how to play a new sport. Practice makes a difference.\nPractise your presenting the right way and learn from others You will make progress more quickly if you lay down the foundations of effective presenting from the start. This instils good practice and will help to develop confidence the right way. If you want to learn how to play the violin but you don’t lay down strong foundations at the start (the correct fingering and technique) it doesn’t matter how much you practise. Without getting the basics right you will just be reinforcing bad technique and will make much slower progress.\nSummary Many business leaders do themselves down and wrongly believe that other leaders have natural confidence in public speaking when they don’t. Confidence is something which can be developed.\nIf you take some simple steps and push yourself every time you do a presentation you will improve and your confidence will soar.\nYou must keep your message simple. You must follow a proven process each time. You must be strategic about what steps you want your audience to take afterwards.\nTake any opportunity you can to rehearse and practise presenting. However, you must do this the right way so you don’t reinforce bad habits.\nPresenting and public speaking are key tools in growing your business, increasing your influence and making an impact. Without confidence to do this well you will achieve less. With confidence you can achieve anything you want.\nFeedback If this article resonates with you and has helped you, please offer some feedback.

It’s a bit like a first date — only the stakes are financial rather than romantic.\nHowever, too many business leaders fail to consider the cost of delivering a bad presentation.\nMany companies fall into the trap of making an invisible first impression. When presenting an idea for the first time — be it a product, a service or a project — the impression they make is invisible. It’s not that they make a bad first impression — though sometimes that happens too — but it’s not a good first impression either. It’s invisible.\nWhen PowerPoint first started to appear in business meetings in the 1990s, little thought went into effective presenting. Everybody was following the same approach with slides packed with too much text, bullet points and details. They were producing cluttered and busy slides. This led to the dreaded ‘Death by PowerPoint’ with which we are all familiar.\nToday, 40 years after we invented PowerPoint, we should know better. There is no reason to deliver a bad presentation when we know what works and what doesn’t.\nCompanies that are still putting together boring presentations are falling behind. As they say, “you never get a second chance to make a first impression.”\nWhen a crucial opportunity to make a great first impression doesn\u0026rsquo;t hit the mark and is entirely unmemorable, what’s the hidden cost?\nThe cost is very real and can be quantified. But what exactly is the hidden cost of a bad presentation?\nWhat’s The Real Cost of a Bad Presentation? So how do you calculate the true cost of a bad presentation? You could analyse how many presentations your company gave in a year, how much time you spent on them and how many of them weren’t effective.\nThen you could take the average salary of someone in your organisation who had worked on the presentations — and work out the hours ‘wasted’.\nBut that would be a very complicated approach. There is a much simpler way. All you need to do is ask yourself two simple questions.\nQ: What’s the value of a great presentation?\nA: The amount of the deal you are trying to win. Or the value of the opportunity you are trying to grab.\nQ: What’s the cost of a bad presentation?\nA: The same. The cost of an ineffective presentation is the amount of the deal you didn’t win. It’s the value of the missed opportunity.\nI recently worked with a marketing and advertising agency. The MD and Head of Growth were keen for the agency to become more proactive in seeking new business. But they were being held back by their presentations.\nDuring a typical pitch the MD and senior leaders would focus on the commercials, the strategy and the top level overview.\nBut they would rely on a team of analysts to go into more depth. Unfortunately, those analysts were too dry and too technical in their delivery, which led to the agency losing out on opportunities.\nIn their case, a typical client brings in £5k/month. They were aiming to convert three new clients a month. Not being able to pitch and present effectively, and losing that business, could have lost them potential income of around £180k per year.\nThe cost to business owners and entrepreneurs of ineffective presentations is therefore easy to calculate.\nEven for those business leaders who don’t run their own businesses there is a cost and a negative impact from poor presentations.\nBusiness leaders are the face of a company. Bad presentations can affect the image of the company and damage their personal credibility too. Not being able to present well can damage people’s reputation and career progression.\nGood Presentations Reduce Costs With product development it tends to be the case that higher quality products cost more to build. But here’s some good news for you. With presentations it’s the opposite.\nThe higher the quality of your presentations, the lower the costs to your organisation because you are more likely to win business. The lower the quality of your presentations, the higher the costs because you will miss out on more business opportunities.\nWhy You Should Make Your Presentations A Priority One practical thing you can do to avoid the cost of bad presentations: stop treating presentations as secondary.\nSo many business owners and leaders regard presentations as something which is nice to have. For them it’s not a priority. Instead, they devote their time and resources into product development and other business matters.\nI get it. Your product or service is the thing you see and work on everyday. The way you communicate your offering can be seen as less tangible.\nOf course your product or service is important. It forms the core of your business and without it your business wouldn’t exist.\nLet me draw a parallel for you. When it comes to publishing content (like this blog), experts recommend that you don’t just focus on the actual writing. It’s also vital to think about how to distribute it so as many people as possible will see it.\nYou can write the best article in the world, but without an effective platform or distribution strategy, no-one will read it. And if no-one reads it the whole exercise was pointless.\nThe same applies to your business.\nYou can have the greatest idea, product, or service in the world, but if you can’t communicate it, it doesn’t matter. So, you should devote as much time (if not more) on preparing to present your ideas effectively as you spend working on the products themselves.\nRemember, it\u0026rsquo;s the quality of your presentation which will win over an audience, not the ideas themselves.\nIn Summary When an audience sits through a bad presentation their mind will feel confused. And what does a confused mind do? Nothing. Your audience won\u0026rsquo;t take action as a result of a bad presentation.\nIf you want to make more sales and win more deals you need to convince your prospects to buy from you.\nIf you want to generate interest in your business from a webinar, you need to create and deliver a powerful presentation that your audience will act upon.\nIf you want to grow your business, you need to persuade and influence your audience that your product or service is right for them.\nSpending time on a great presentation can reduce costs. It means you are less likely to lose out on new business.\nYou can have the greatest idea in the world, but if you can’t communicate it effectively, it doesn’t matter.\nFeedback If you enjoyed this article, I would love to hear your feedback.

The more prepared and structured your approach, the more confident you will be.\nMost business leaders don’t follow any sort of organised process when preparing a presentation. Keen to get started, they launch into things and hope for the best. We’ve all seen the person who decides to wing it or who turns up with chaotic notes.\nPeople who deliver presentations which lack structure:\nCommunicate their message badly Can’t sense if their message is landing with the audience Risk losing the audience This creates frustration for the speaker who risks missing out on important opportunities. In turn, this leads to insecurity and they lose faith in their ability to deliver powerful presentations. It’s like a vicious circle: the more this happens, the more frustration and the more insecurity.\nTo avoid getting trapped into that negative cycle, it’s very important to prepare and plan.\nPut a structure in place If you want to feel confident in your content and in your ability to deliver it, you must follow a structured process.\nConfidence does not come from belief in yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s about having confidence in what you are saying, because you have put a great deal of thought into it in advance.\nReal confidence is built on strong foundations, not blind self-belief.\nLee Warren in The Busy Person’s Guide To Great Presenting explains that confidence comes from three things:\nKnowing your audience Knowing your message Being prepared Before you even start planning a presentation, ask yourself who the audience will be? What do you want to communicate to them? What actions do you want them to take after the presentation?\nHaving established who the audience is, you can think clearly about your message and work on what you want to say.\nIf you are well prepared, and follow a clear process, you will have real confidence. Your confidence on the day you come to do the presentation will be genuine and deep.\nSuccess in public speaking depends on the process you follow, not on how hard you try. Confidence comes from the process.\nI recently worked with Cam Beaudoin, founder of The A11y Coder. He is an expert on Digital Accessibility, which, by his own admission, can be a dry subject. He was looking to improve his presentation skills.\nCam is a naturally charismatic guy but he came to us because he was giving ‘chaotic presentations’ too often (his own words).\nWe helped him to put together a framework which he now uses whenever he is building and getting ready for a presentation. It has freed Cam up to focus on the message and on delivering it in his own style — without so much worry.\nWhat Cam came to realise was that creating and delivering an effective presentation does not happen by chance. Even the greatest communicator in the world still needs material to work with and will have worked hard to prepare it.\nThe most creative presentations come from process and planning. When you have structures in place, it gives you the building blocks to make more creative presentations.\nAs long ago as 1926 Graham Wallas, co-founder of the London School of Economics, wrote a seminal work about the creative process called The Art of Thought. In it, he outlined a four step process for creativity:\nPreparation. The stage during which the problem is investigated Incubation. When you allow ideas to brew unconsciously Illumination. When the ‘happy idea’ surfaces Verification. When you go back to work on the idea further. Our proven five step process At Ideas on Stage we have helped thousands of clients to improve their public speaking since 2010, using a well-established five-step process.\nIf you want to improve your confidence in public speaking and presenting, try following these strategies.\nFOUNDATION: Ask yourself some questions about your audience and their needs. What is the context of the presentation? IDEATION: Take time to brainstorm and develop your key messages. What do you want your audience to know, feel and do after your presentation? CREATION: Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to build a clear and engaging storyline. The simplest and most effective presentation storyline begins with a strong introduction that catches the audience’s attention, develops three key messages, then concludes with a summary and a call to action. Make it clear to the audience what your point was and why they should care about it. ILLUSTRATION: Build in some simple and effective visual aids that support your messages. Avoid the dreaded Death by PowerPoint. Keep your slides simple and visual. People can’t read and listen at the same time. CONNECTION: Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. With your presentation mapped out and prepared, go over it a few times. This way you will be able to present naturally, connect with your audience and deliver authentically. Get your priorities right With a presentation looming, the worst thing you can do is feel you don’t have time to prepare — and risk skipping our five stages.\nRushing into a presentation and cutting corners will end badly and knock your confidence.\nThink you lack time to go through this process? Think twice. You don’t lack time, you lack priorities.\nOne of my previous clients was Patrick Tyrance Jr, a Harvard-trained Orthopaedic Surgeon and Entrepreneur. He is a very busy man with demands on his time. We worked together to refine his public speaking skills and create a presentation about a new business. Much of our work was about correct preparation.\nAfter we worked together, Patrick shared a great analogy. He explained that, as a surgeon, he always goes through any procedure in his mind before he even gets to the hospital. That way, by the time he arrives, he is already prepared and can remain calm for the procedure.\nHis work as a surgeon is more important than any speech. But it\u0026rsquo;s fascinating that he drew those parallels — and had not himself recognised the parallels and the importance of preparing for a presentation in the same way.\nIn summary A powerful presentation and a confident delivery will not come by chance. Even if you are under time pressure to deliver a speech you must still prepare properly. The better your preparation, the better job you will do.\nReal confidence doesn’t come from self-belief, it comes from adequate preparation — which anyone can learn.\nIf you take the time to follow the process you will reap the benefits. You will feel more in control when presenting and you will be able to relax and enjoy it. You will come across as confident to your audience.\nThe five-step process can be applied to many different scenarios — whether it\u0026rsquo;s a new business pitch, a sales presentation, an investor pitch or a leadership speech. The plan works just as well for a presentation in person or on-line.\nGet properly prepared and you will find that presenting becomes exciting not daunting.\nFeedback If this article has helped you, I would appreciate any feedback.

The best writing gets to the point. The greatest speeches are concise and direct.\nHowever, too many business leaders fall into the trap of giving presentations which are overly complex and technical. They navigate their audience down side roads and off on tangents. Their visuals mirror this and are often confusing and convoluted.\nWhy does this happen? It is all done for the right reasons. We are talking about high achievers who have set up their own businesses and who are leaders in their field.\nThe problem is that these experts are often too close to their subject and are too keen to demonstrate their knowledge to their audience.\nBecause they know so much about their subjects, they are inclined to include too many details and convey too much information.\nThere is also a tendency to resort to jargon, acronyms and industry-specific terminology.\nAs a result, the audience:\ncan’t follow, understand or remember is left confused doesn’t take action Too Much Technology One of the main issues is that we rely too much on technology when preparing a presentation. Technology provides us with tools and templates. The latest version of PowerPoint even automatically suggests lovely looking alternative designs. There are thousands of potential shapes to deploy and images to include. Then there’s video and GIFs. The temptation is to throw everything at your slides, including the kitchen sink.\nIn reality, your ability to deliver a great presentation has nothing to do with the software you use or the screen behind you. It has everything to do with the key message and story you want to convey.\nTechnology continues to evolve at a frightening pace. Microsoft PowerPoint was first released in April 1987. Back then, you could use it to create black and white sheets for overhead projectors. We are now up to Version 17, known as PowerPoint 2019.\nSo much has changed in that time with the adoption of cloud technology and video calls. Computing power, according to Moore’s Law, has doubled every two years.\nMeanwhile, the human brain has been evolving for millions of years. Our human ancestors of 200,000 years ago were probably of similar intelligence to us. We have been sharing stories for generations since we were first able to speak—without the need to put some bullet points on a deck.\nNo wonder then that a recent study by design agency Presentation Panda found that 79 per cent of people agree that most presentations are boring.\nDeciding Your Message If you want to communicate a simple and clear message that is relevant to the audience, you must start with the basic question—what do I want to say?\nThen you must be utterly ruthless in deciding what to include and what to leave out. Unless it helps to convey your central argument then it must go.\nCreate a clear storyline so your audience will be able to follow you, remember what you say and take appropriate action.\nI recently worked with Miguel Marcos Martinez, CEO and Co-Founder of ioCommit. By his own admission, he used to overpack his presentations with too many details. We helped him to create a memorable pitch which focused on delivering a clear message in a non-technical way.\nHe said afterwards: “I feel much more confident about our message and ready to steer the audience. The result is that everyone now understands what we are building, not just the technically adept.”\nThree Tips to Improve So what can you do to change your presentation style and get to the point? Here are three practical tips:\nStart by summarizing your core idea in 70 words (which should take 30 seconds to deliver). If you can’t communicate it in that short time, your message is too complex. You need to make it simpler. Follow the Rule of Three. Include just three key messages. It is the same tactic which media trainers tell their clients for TV interviews. Stick to the three points you want to get across. This is very effective and also gives your presentation a good balance and rhythm. Use simple words where possible. Using fancy language does not make you sound more clever. It just distorts what you are trying to communicate. The best writing is often the simplest. The best speakers adopt the same tactic and use the least number of words to convey their points. It’s Hard to Keep Things Simple Keeping things simple takes effort. You have to edit down your presentation and reduce it to the most basic form. Strip it of long, confusing sentences. Get rid of the jargon and the business speak. Lose the industry-specific terminology that only some of your audience will understand. Be inclusive and ensure that your language is accessible to everyone.\nDo not assume knowledge on the part of your audience. It is fine to explain things to ensure that you bring everyone along with you. If some of the audience already knew something you said, they will simply feel reassured. It would be far worse to make the mistake of assuming your audience had some prior understanding when they did not.\nWhat’s your objective when presenting? Maybe you want to sell a product, service, project or idea. Maybe you want to convince someone of something. Maybe you want to persuade or inspire your audience.\nWhatever it is, you want to take your audience on a journey from A to B. They will start at point A where they don’t know, believe, or feel what you want them to—and travel with you to point B where they do.\nIf your message is too complex, this is what it looks like when trying to take your audience from A to B.\nIt would be like me shouting a foreign language at you and hoping you will understand.\nIf you simplify your message, this is what it looks like:\nAchieving your objective will be much easier.\nSummary Business leaders sometimes know so much they mistakenly include too many details and too many messages in their presentations. As a result they lose impact and do not achieve the results they want. You will persuade your audience more effectively if you keep the message simple.\nIf you deliver a whole presentation in which everything is deemed to be important, then it reduces everything to the same level—and nothing is important. Decide what your key messages are and stick to them. A good trick is to use the power of three.\nIf you follow these rules and simplify your message, your audience will follow, understand, remember and take action!\nIf you enjoyed this article, I would love to hear your feedback.

Think about the tools we can use today to communicate our ideas to the world. Now, compare that with the tools we had a few years ago. Today in most industries we have more competition—not only from a business perspective but also from a communication perspective.\nThe tools we have today are designed to empower people—lots of people—to share their message with the world.\nAnd that’s a good thing. Today, anyone from anywhere in the world can communicate with their clients from their bedroom. Today, anyone from anywhere in the world can do that for free. Today, anyone from anywhere in the world who has an idea also has a massive potential to get their idea heard.\nHaving said that, it’s not that simple.\nTechnology makes communication so “easy” that there’s a lot of noise out there. Everyone is communicating and this makes it harder for you to stand out.\nToday more than ever, having a good idea isn’t good enough. If you have a good idea—be it a product, a service or a business—you need to be able to communicate it in an effective way.\nBusiness owners, leaders and their teams who struggle to present a compelling message face five key problems.\n1. Their message is too complex They know so much about their subject and are so close to it that they think that everything is important. So they think they need to communicate everything. But from the audience’s perspective, if everything is important, nothing is important. Most business leaders include too much information in their presentations. They overpack their message and find it hard to simplify it.\nThey think their message is simple and clear but the audience thinks it’s confusing. And in communication if you confuse you lose—you lose your audience and their attention.\nBecause of that, the audience doesn’t understand their message, doesn’t remember it and they don’t act.\n2. They follow an uncertain process So many presenters tell me, “I’ve been presenting for a long time but every time I do, I don’t know if I’m doing it right. I don’t know if the process I’m following is correct.” They lack confidence not in themselves but in the process. Audience analysis, brainstorming, storyline, slide design, rehearsing. There is a structured way of thinking about presenting. Not following a proven process creates discomfort in front of an audience.\n3. They miss out on important opportunities Businesses lose deals, sales and money because of how leaders and their teams present. Businesses get stuck because of how we communicate our ideas. And you don’t have to be running your own business to see the impact of this. If you’re a business leader, you’re the face of your company. So bad presentations affect the image of your company and your credibility as well.\n4. Their message is not relevant Let’s say that in a few weeks you need to give a presentation and today you start working on it. Where would you start? What’s the first thing you do when preparing a presentation?\nWhat we see every day is that the first thing most business leaders do is they open PowerPoint. Or they start thinking about their message, the outline or the agenda. The latter approach is better than starting with PowerPoint but it’s not the first thing you want to do.\nWhen you give a presentation, you’re communicating with someone, so you need to start with them. When you give a presentation, it’s their presentation, not yours. It’s the audience’s presentation.\nThink of a presentation as a present. If I want to give you a present, it’s your present not mine, so I need to make sure I know you so that I can buy something you like. When you give people a presentation, it’s their presentation not yours. So you need to make sure you know your audience before you open PowerPoint or think about your message. Your message depends on the audience, their needs and the context.\n5. Their call to action isn’t specific What do you want your audience to do? What’s the immediate next step you want your audience to take? So many presenters aren’t specific enough when it comes to their call to action.\nLet’s take the example of a webinar where the aim is for the audience to express their interest in a discovery call. Most presenters say something like “If you think you need a bit of help on[their area of expertise], then I’m happy to offer a 30-minute discovery call.”\nThe problem is, even if somebody in the audience wants a discovery call, they don’t know what they need to do. They don’t know how to signal their interest. As a result, they won’t do it. The call to action isn’t specific.\nInstead, you could say something like “If you’d like to learn more about how what we’ve covered today could work for you, you can express your interest today in a 30-minute discovery call via Zoom. Just type YES in the chat now and we’ll get in touch to see if you qualify. If that’s the case, we’ll arrange a time for a call.”\nIn this case people know what they have to do to signal their interest. They simply need to type YES in the chat. It’s a small change that makes a huge difference.\nIn summary In this article we covered the five key problems business leaders face when giving presentations.\nThe consequence of this isn’t good.\nMost ideas fail only because of how we communicate them. Often the idea is great, the problem is how we present our idea. It might sound a bit dramatic but that’s what we see every day. This is what creates frustration for missing out on important opportunities. And the more that happens, the less confident we are as presenters.\nBut it doesn’t have to be that way…\nAnd this leads to a different story which will need another article.\nPS: If you want to become a more confident presenter, take the Confident Presenter Scorecard.

For Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen this was their second debate, the last being back in 2017. But last night’s debate was very different.\nNow, from a policy point of view, many views were exchanged on the environment, security, the economy and the current international context amongst many others. While we could debate the details and validity of the points made here, I will leave that to the journalists.\nToday I want to discuss the “soft skills” aspect of this debate and compare them with what I observed five years ago. Five years ago we had a very different debate. One marred in the context of a more boisterous and theatrical political context. The communication was, in short: violent.\nIf we could attribute verbs to Marine Le Pen’s attacks then those verbs would be “to goad, to diminish, to mock and to accuse.” At times it was difficult to watch the mudslinging and Macron used all his agility to work through it, keep his balance and and appeal to France’s reason. When Le Pen finished the debate with the jibe “fils de Hollande” (son of François Hollande who at the time was the outgoing president), she set herself up as a kind of pantomime villain. She lost the election and received much criticism for the credibility of her performance (even from her own father).\nNow, from a public speaking point of view, this was an extrovert, expansive performance. Let’s use the analogy of Goldilocks and the 3 bears, and in particular the 3 bowls of porridge part of the story as a way to identify balance when public speaking.\nIf the porridge is too cold, the communication is soft, lacks energy, conviction and confidence and provokes frustration or pity from the audience. If the porridge is too hot, it becomes aggressive, overpowering, over controlling and generates bad feelings of oppression from the audience. In the case of Le Pen’s performance back in 2017, the porridge was too hot. It pushed much of the audience away with uncomfortable feelings and ultimately she floundered under her own violence. Macron even said so himself to journalists just after the debate that it was too incendiary and downright bizarre.\nFast forward 5 years (and I was dreading to have to sit through another like this) this time Marine Le Pen served up a new dish of porridge. One much more measured and effective. Certainly less violent. As I’ve stated earlier, in goldilocks, we have the porridge that is too hot and the porridge that is too cold. Last night the porridge (from a soft skills perspective) was just right. Having taken on board the criticism, Marine Le Pen sounded calmer, more credible and reined in her attacks within a measured circle of communication. At no point did I get that feeling of oppression that I felt during the previous debate. It was a considered performance, even cautious, albeit cold and accusatory in content. For Macron, however, I would argue this worked to his advantage. Her willingness to talk policy allowed him to shine, his brilliance and clear mastery of detail and dossier being difficult for anyone to match. The only thing that he needed to be careful on was the way he addressed his opponent. At times he was condescending with her when presented with numbers that didn’t add up or false information and he was clearly trying to rein that in.\nAs I finish this article, I am reminded how much importance we give to leaders and their soft skills performances in the modern day. We must not forget that when ultimately elected, they bring an entourage of people and policies that could dramatically shift the direction of any country. Yes, Le Pen had learned from past mistakes, but improving her performance in a 2 and half hour debate has very little meaning in the scheme of things. We need to look beyond the performance of a candidate. The devil, my friends, is ALWAYS in the detail.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/04/21/2022-04-21-soft-skills-the-2022-french-presidential-debate/","summary":"","tags":["Debate"],"title":"Soft Skills: The 2022 French Presidential Debate"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Misinformation is the scourge of our time. It confuses and divides us and can do irreparable harm. What can we do to fight it?\nFor the majority of us today working in business, life is good. In the last 15 years or so, I have observed huge improvements in the way large companies and corporations respond and communicate with their customers and peers on issues that matter: climate change, DE\u0026amp;I and Digital transformation being the most important. Our leaders now actually tell stories that inspire us and share their vulnerabilities. We have seen workspaces improve both in comfort, facilities and aesthetic. Our working weeks have become more flexible than ever, on average spending 2 days of our working week at home. Our children see us more and many of us no longer have to wait for retirement to do the things we really want to do. All of this, whether you are grateful for it or not, is in direct response to the commoditization of our individual power; from the small devices in our pockets accessing the information that we need to the social media accounts that we use and give us a voice that our peers listen to. We have come far and quickly. But the 21st century, for all its advances, is bringing us new problems, by actors who wish to reverse this empowerment. One of the weapons in their armory is misinformation, a kind of noxious drip-feed of poison, which is causing us irreparable harm.\nIf I tell you, as you read this, that Apple is in serious financial trouble, most of you will probably dismiss it as rubbish. Some of you will go and check on Google, though, read something about complex financials, long-term risks and unsold products and there perhaps some doubt will begin to creep in. There are forces out there that want to see Apple fail and make money from it. If I were to tell you that the color Red is now the new Black, there may be stuff online about that as well, and what follows is muddy confusion.\nAnother word I want to add here is gaslighting. Here is a simple definition: “To manipulate someone by psychological means into doubting their own sanity.” Misinformation works like this. It clouds the victims’ judgment, making them doubt everything and believing something false. It is as old as time itself and was used to support every abuse of power there ever was. Today, people are grappling with fundamental truths and untruths and discourse is tainted. In some companies today, it is literally an offense for people to share their views in case of deep disharmony. This not good for cohesion and relationships and gives employers another thing to worry about.\nSo what can we do to fight it? I believe it’s actually quite a deep-rooted and complex problem, difficult to solve in 4 bullet points. But here are some simple but important things to think about based on what I’ve experienced and researched:\nGet news from trusted and multiple sources. It’s all too tempting to only listen to our favorite YouTuber and sources that reinforce our own views. Get perspective from multiple outlets, even ones you don’t care for. Build your own peer network of clear-minded friends and colleagues. Their feedback may be indispensable on your views. Be open to debating with them even if you don’t agree and know when to stop. We have to learn to disagree and get along. Work on yourself. Emotions are driving the propagation of misinformation and are what keep people entrenched: anger, fear and grief being the most powerful. What’s driving you? Take distance from misinformation. If you are exposed to blatant misinformation via a relationship or family member, distance yourself. No one is immune. Like all communication, whether it is writing an article or pitching sales, the target of misinformation is the human brain. Psychology plays a huge part in this, as do our emotions. It seems to me that manipulation and misinformation are all about framing a problem where there isn’t one, or reversely pretending there isn’t a problem when there is one. Our world is complicated and at times does not make sense. Perhaps those choosing the oblivion of conspiracy and utopia are running away from this truth: chaos and uncertainty are a part of all of our lives. But you’ll never know how good your life is and how free you are… Until it’s too late.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/03/29/2022-03-29-the-communication-battle-facing-us-all/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"The Communication Battle Facing Us All"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy has reached the parts that other leaders haven’t reached in a long time.\nAfter weeks of an army build-up on the borders of Ukraine from the Russian state, and on the eve of a massive Russian invasion, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy, hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned, made a video statement to his people from the centre of Kyiv which inspired not only Ukrainians, but also the rest of the world to the core:\n“Good evening everyone, faction leader David Arakhamia is here, head of presidential office Andriy Yermak is here, Prime Minister Denys Smyhal is here, Presidential adviser Mykahlio Podolyak is here, President (Zelenskiy myself) is here, our troops are here, our citizens are here, all of us are here defending the independence of our country and it will continue to be this way. Glory to our defenders, glory to our heroes, glory to Ukraine.****”\nIn just a few sentences, the people listened, stood, raised their fists and shouted expletives to their invaders. But since that first night address, we’ve had some stark one-liners that point to his courage: “I don’t need a ride, I need ammunition,” and his humility “Each of us is a president, a fighter.”\nZelenskiy’s video appeal to Russian citizens, spoken clearly and convincingly in Russian, was a powerful example of transformational communication, aimed at the hearts of Russian citizens, with a clear audience and objective in mind, addressing the beliefs they had been fed by Russian media, and with clear calls to action. This may go down in time as one of the strongest presentations of the century.\nNow go back 3 years to the election of Volodymyr Zelenskiy and for those of us outside of Ukraine and not in the details of their politics, it seemed a bit doubtful that a rank outsider Netflix Actor/Comedian could really have been a credible presidential candidate. Perhaps Vladimir Putin was counting on a soft and easy target who would cede easily to pressure later on down the line.\nBut what we are witnessing is legendary. On day 6 of the war, as I write this, Russia, led by Putin, is facing incredibly stiff resistance inspired by a leader who not only inspires with his words, but equally with his actions. By rejecting the easy option of fleeing Kyiv, and staying with his people, he inspired respect and confidence, and through his powerful speeches, each to a specific audience and with specific objectives, he has also inspired through his words. The Ukrainian resistance may ultimately prove futile, but there is no doubt that it has been so much stronger thanks to the powerful leadership of their president.\nWhichever side you take in this conflict, which is a dire situation, it is hard for anyone to be left unimpressed by Zelenskiy’s leadership in the past week, and any business leaders would do well to take inspiration from his performance and ask themselves the fundamental questions: What kind of leader do I want to be in my organization? Do I practice what I preach?\nMany see people from acting or artistic backgrounds as not serious political leaders. I don’t know where this comes from but I challenge it wholeheartedly. Critical thinking goes hand in hand with the arts. Some of our finest thought leaders are artists and an artist’s bravery and creative thinking are valuable in times of war. And if the ability to inspire people is a key success factor for any leader, the oratory skills of an actor can be a great strength, as Zelenskiy has clearly shown.\nSome seek greatness and others have it thrust upon them. In this case it is the latter. We don’t know how it will turn out, and I dread the day when I might read that Kyiv has fallen. But Zelenskiy’s inspiration has already touched the world. War is ugly and only resolved through peace. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/03/02/2022-03-08-great-leaders-move-mountains/","summary":"","tags":["Leadership"],"title":"Great Leaders Move Mountains"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Michael Rickwood from Ideas on Stage on how he got to meet the man who started it all for the presentation world.\nOnce in a while we set ourselves some great tasks. Interviewing my presentation hero was a particularly appealing one. Over the years I have read many great books on business communication and have taken inspiration from authors from all facets of our industry: Nancy Duarte, Garr Reynolds, Patsy Rodenburg, Dan and Chip Heath, Guy Kawasaki, Simon Sinek, Dan Pink, Dr. John Medina, Roger Mavity to name but a few. But there is one author whose books I come back to consistently, who, in my opinion, is the founding father of what we are all doing today in the presentations consulting industry. That author is Jerry Weissman.\nA graduate from Stanford University, Jerry worked for years in Television in New York, in the 70s and 80s, editing shows and learning from the stage professionals how to interview and how to conduct oneself in front of the camera. Through the advice of a friend in the 1980s, Jerry decided to take his acquired media training skills and bring them to Silicon Valley and work in the business tech sector with emerging unicorns such as Netflix and Cisco. According to his books, Jerry’s influence helped inflate the stock price of these companies. Jerry coached many fledgling companies through the IPO Roadshow process, a series of pitching events to prospective investors and their associates which is native to the US. Today, we see the equivalent in the form of Start Up demo days pitching Venture Capitalists.\nFor many years I’ve been citing Jerry during my training courses, often assuming in the last few years that he was retired. I was very surprised after my colleague Andrea Pacini actually found him still running a rebranded version of his consultancy out of New York San Francisco.\nInterviewing Jerry was an absolute pleasure. Deeply knowledgeable about his art and the world I was particularly struck by the research he did for our interview. He was aware that I was based in France and made many references to the French language and culture throughout our interview, partly because I think he has a great love for the culture but also because he had prepared. There was a lesson to be learned even from interviewing him. May I add, I had certainly prepared on my side and he was extremely grateful for that.\nSo, please enjoy the interview. Don’t hesitate to reach out to those who inspire you, you may be pleasantly surprised.\nThe interview is available here:\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2022/01/18/2022-01-18-my-interview-with-jerry-weissman/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"My Interview with Jerry Weissman"},{"author":"Joe Ross","contents":"We have recently completed coaching all the finalists for the latest installment of the INSEAD Venture Competition (IVC), an event where over one hundred teams of entrepreneurs pitch their start-up ideas for cash prizes.

During this webinar we share our methodologies to cover the fundamentals of creating a winning pitch. We think about the audience and their specific needs, define key messages, create a compelling storyline, design handsome visuals, work out the specifics of pitching virtually, and allow time for a question and answer session.\nAfter the semi-finals, the field is narrowed to seven teams. This is when we roll up our sleeves and work team by team with each of the finalist to level up their semifinal pitches and hone their delivery styles.\nThe challenge is always the same for everyone, how to present in just a few minutes a complicated project. One such example is that which was faced by team Switch-E, who eventually won the social impact prize. Their project takes on the climate change issue. They have developed an app that you can use to turn off unnecessary electrical appliances during the spike periods of demand when electricity is not only more expensive, but is often much dirtier because clean suppliers have to buy electricity from coal or other based plants at a premium. The challenge was how to tell the story of involving climate change, electricity markets, and consumer behavior. Our solution was to base it around the simple idea that everyone matters, and every action counts. We showed how a college student on a budget and worried about her future on the planet could make a big impact by using the app to turn off all but critical appliances during the peak. And not only that, she could entice her friends to do the same by a gamified community building feature of the app.\nWorking on all the pitches in this manned resulted in a final round where the judges were wowed by the improvements of the presentations from the state they were in during the semifinals.\nThis live competition is streamed internationally and is keenly watched by hundreds of potential angel investors, venture capital firms, and interested business leaders. Many unicorns have gotten their start from this competition and we are happy to play our part. We all are winners as these young entrepreneurs work a way to make the world a better place.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/12/23/2021-12-23-it-is-always-the-season-for-giving/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"It is always the Season for Giving"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Say what you like about Boris Johnson, his style connects with the mob. Our institutional leaders need to put aside their intellectual bias and start figuring out why it’s working.\nLast month in London, Boris Johnson gave a speech at the Confederation of British Industry in South Shields in the North of England. He stumbled, got lost in his notes, and started talking about Peppa Pig. You might start reading this and assume where it’s going. That a British prime minister talking about a children’s cartoon character, a Picasso-esque hairdryer shaped pig, in an address to senior business leaders, was an embarrassment and makes the UK look weak on the international business stage? Perhaps, but mock Boris Johnson at your peril.\nWhile we can debate the seriousness of the example and question its suitability for the audience, you have to admit that he knows how to make a headline and he knows how to keep us engaged. It was yet another stroke of headline-grabbing genius. Not often do we see someone who possesses such a unique talent for taking risk in public speaking and fearlessly breaking the rules of communication strategy. Despite many conversations I have with clients, friends, and family, who frown on Johnson’s style, he is a skilled public speaker. He’s original, has a commanding vocabulary yet knows how to keep it simple. He possesses a likability that keeps people voting for him, even when it goes against their own interests.\nIn my line of work, I am brought in to help people find this kind of creativity, to find analogies and anecdotes that resonate and help people extrapolate meaning from the numbers. If you follow the logic of Johnson’s Peppa Pig example, it checks out. He’s trying to say that this theme park, Peppa Pig World, which, according to Johnson in his speech, brings in 6 bn into the UK economy and was initially dismissed by the BBC as a bad idea, has proved to be another beacon of a deeply innovative UK creative business spirit against all odds. Many clients come to me with a need for ideas to communicate easily and effectively across their teams. Many leaders and companies would benefit from a more direct and imaginative style of communication, even if they think they don’t.\nI work with many types of business leaders and executives. One type of leader I have particularly had the privilege of working with over the years are our senior leaders in UN organizations. In my mind these are bastions of our collective civilized cooperation and should be cherished as such. Our institutions are the bedrock of our progress, comprising of societies’ finest minds, each of them having worked tirelessly to educate themselves and rise to the top of their classes. However, there is a pervasive culture of stiff and scripted communication around its senior leadership which struggles against the easy appeal of a populist leader. Already at least one half of any population around the world are tuned out of and aren’t interested in the press conferences given by the likes of the WHO or the ECB. Our institutions need to adapt their communication in 2021, make it more accessible, easier to follow (and yes, sometimes remove the ties around the necks of its speakers).\nNow I understand the argument that populist leaders should be ignored, that they are the problem in itself, but this is not true. A lot of people compare Johnson with Trump, which is fair; Trump has a similar instinctiveness for his crowd and they both like to make headlines. It just remains to be seen how Jonson will deal with the next transition, whether he’ll put country first or not. But breaking the rules and being creative does not always mean an autocrat in the making.\nTake what you secretly like from Johnson and leave the rest.\nTo finish this article, I too have opinions on Boris Johnson, but they have no place here. I will finish on one thought, though. When we work with business leaders, one of the core principles we use is to be disciplined. Know your audience and your key messages in advance, then work out how you will deliver them. So while Peppa Pig got us talking, digging a little deeper and using a little more graft might have yielded a better result. Boris Johnson’s comradery and risk-taking is what makes him appealing, but it is also his greatest weakness. He relies too much on his talents and luck, and no speaker should. History shows us that when that luck runs out, it usually gets pretty ugly. I hope for him when it’s inevitably time to move on he’ll accept that with good humor and foresight.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/12/07/2021-12-07-boris-johnson-s-peppa-pig-moment/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"Boris Johnson’s Peppa Pig Moment"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Why a 13-year-old speech given by a former US president holds a blueprint solution for our modern problem.\nIn 2008, during his campaigning, Barack Obama gave a rallying speech in Wisconsin on the power of words and resistance to hope. “Don’t tell me words don’t matter! I have a dream, just words?! All men are created equal, just words?!” It’s true that speeches don’t solve all problems, but what is also true is if we cannot inspire the country to believe again then it doesn’t matter how many policies and plans we have.\nIt was a rebuke on cynicism and inertia from elements within his own political establishment who saw Obama’s messaging as blind optimism. “Don’t tell me ideals and inspiration don’t matter. Don’t tell me hope doesn’t matter!” he goes on to say in reference to coming from a broken home and modest means “because it’s very unlikely that I’m standing on this stage here tonight.”\nWithout going through the whole speech, the main idea that Obama planted here is that hope can conquer adversity by inspiring courage in all of us to dare to face that adversity. He challenges this when he says “Kennedy didn’t look up at the moon and say ‘that’s too far. We can’t go.’ False hopes. Martin Luther King didn’t stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and say, ’go home everybody. The dream’s deferred. False hopes. You all need a reality check.”\nIn hindsight of Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure, he had an undeniable positive impact on the world. Stronger international relations and economies, a recovered domestic economy, better access to health care for all. There were also some domestic missteps such as the handling of the Flint water crisis and a seeming ineptitude with dealing with Republicans who always seemed to get the upper hand.\nSo why am I talking about this now? Because in that 2008 speech is the template of arguments for what needs now as we face the mother of all complex problems. Climate change.\nWhen he says that \u0026ldquo;nothing worthwhile has ever happened except somebody somewhere was willing to hope\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, nothing worthwhile has ever happened without someone willing to hope and taking the courage to act, then counters with “That’s how slaves and abolitionists resisted that wicked system. That’s how that greatest generation defeated Hitler and rose out of a Great Depression and That’s how women won the right to vote.” The list goes on…\nObama talks about hope in the face of adversity. In a nutshell, dealing with complex problems in a determined, cool, constructive manner by garnering support through inspiration, specifics and optimism. Because fear and greenwashing breed inertia. Life is awash with problems and gravity, puling us down. To quote another American, Sylvester Stallone, who recently said in a documentary that \u0026ldquo;we as people are all dealing with problems in life. Those who succeed the most in their lives are those dealing with their problems in the smartest way\u0026rdquo;.\nIn 2021, we have a huge complex challenge, which is climate change. It is perhaps our greatest problem ever. Listening to our leaders today at COP 26, a lot of it sounds like blind optimism. It’s no doubt that Greta Thunberg’s honesty is not only stark but at times disheartening. She’s angry and so should she be, her generation, my son’s generation, will have to deal with this nightmare if left unchecked.\nBut what’s the resistance to it all? Inertia? Pessimism? Denial? Most likely fear. The simple truth is we all owe banks money, we all need to eat today, so everybody keeps chipping away in the same direction, working hard, despite ourselves, because we all fear losing what we have. This is how difficult the problem is.\nThe story and the words that we need are templated right here in Barack Obama’s words. What’s needed are ideas and solutions but above all we need hope. Without it, we will never have the courage to take the leap of faith. Leaders hold the key, their words, their mindsets can cascade to get the bottom-up solution we need. The template is there, somebody else just needs to pick up the baton.\nArnold Schwarzenegger recently said in a BBC interview on climate change is that “citizens all over the world don’t just need metrics and tons, they need a story.” They need to understand that the problem is theirs, maybe not now, but it will be, and we all have to own a piece of it.\nObama was a great US President, an inspirer in chief and not without his flaws. But it’s not the messenger here that I’m talking about. It’s the message. We can all take that message and put it to good use today.\nWilling to hope on radical solutions is the only thing that can take us beyond climate change, and getting that message right, and delivered convincingly is what we are dedicated to and why we created our company. What can you do?\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/11/09/2021-11-09-word-matter/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Words Matter: words breed inspiration, inspiration breeds hope, hope breeds action."},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Business Presentation Revolution covers the five stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, giving you a simple, proven process to follow to prepare and deliver successful presentations every time.\nIn this extract from Business Presentation Revolution, author Phil Waknell outlines the fifth and final stage: Connection.\nHaving the fastest, best designed and most attractive car doesn’t guarantee you’ll win the race. The performance of the driver is just as important.\nLikewise, when presenting, a poor performance can make great material fall flat, but a strong presenter can make average material shine.\nIn the Connection stage, we prepare mentally and physically to ensure we are ready to make a personal connection with our audience, communicate with them, and transform them.\nNo business audience enjoys a monologue or a speaker who appears to be talking to themselves. Remember: it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. Since communication is more about what they receive than what you send, it’s vital to build a connection with them so they are part of your presentation and paying full attention.\nThis means you need to pay attention to your audience and how they are reacting to your messages – and adapt your presentation accordingly. Aim to interact with your audience as much as possible and to bring them into the presentation. The more you can connect on a personal, human level with your audience, the more likely they will be to overlook your imperfections and want you to succeed – and the more attentively they will listen.\nRemember your transformational objectives. What do you need your audience to do, feel and believe? Your objective is not to deliver your presentation exactly as planned: it is to transform your audience.\nHere is a brief summary of the key points of this all-important final stage:\nGood speakers SCORE when speaking:\nSimple: use short sentences and plain language, with regular pauses Clear: make sure they can hear and understand every syllable Original: find your own style, accept it and hone it Related: create a connection through interaction, eye contact and gestures Enjoyable: prepare well so you appear comfortable, show your passion, and vary your tone and rhythm As the big day approaches, focus on the 3 S’s:\nSerenity: rehearse your presentation several times, focusing especially on the introduction and conclusion, and prepare a cue-card Space: get to know the place or platform where you will be presenting Support: connect with the technical people and brief them, so they know what you need and can help you succeed. On the big day, arrive early, try to greet some audience members before you begin, avoid coffee, prepare yourself physically, and manage your time well.\nAfter the presentation, deliver your handouts, ask for feedback, and note what you could do differently next time.\nAbove all, treat every presentation you give as an opportunity to practice and improve. Nobody was born a great presenter. If you’re amazed at how professional the speakers appear at TED or WikiStage or some major online product launches, and feel you aren’t yet at the same level, just remember that those presenters had to work hard to become that good, and they usually have presentation specialists to help them.\nI have never yet met anyone who did not have the potential to become a strong speaker. With time, effort and perhaps some speaker coaching, you can become the kind of presenter people look forward to listening to.

So, if your slide features a lot of text and detail, it might make a useful reference document but a terrible visual aid. If you follow my advice and keep your slides simple, with only a few words, they’ll be good visual aids but worthless as handouts.\nMost people try to do something in the middle and end up with too little text for a useful reference document but too much for a visual aid – 50% slide, 50% document, 0% effective.\nIn the Illustration stage, you will first work out whether your audience will benefit from handouts, then determine whether some slides might help them during your presentation, and if so, prepare suitable visual aids that won’t stop them from listening.\nWhat you say is important, but the quality of your visual aids can have a huge positive or negative impact. Telling a great story with ugly slides is like giving somebody expensive jewelry in a supermarket plastic bag.\nI think of slides as “visual aids” for a presentation, and just that semantic change helps clients break out of the typical perception of a slide and focus on what kind of visuals will aid their audience’s understanding and recollection of their key messages.\nYour slides should SCORE:\nSimple: Each time you click, your audience should understand all the new content in under five seconds. If they take more than five seconds to “get it”, they will miss what you are saying. Clear: Everything is easy to read and understand on a smartphone screen, in terms of size and contrast. Original: Your slides look new and stand out compared to competitors’ and other speakers’ slides. Related: What you show is related to what you are saying at that time. Enjoyable: Your slides are well-designed and attractive, making your audience enjoy discovering each new slide. You might also need to deliver some handouts. No matter how well your slides SCORE, the audience will soon forget what you say and what you show, so it may be wise to give them something to read before your presentation and to leave something behind – but not an ugly slideument that is neither a good slide nor a good document.\nHere is an overview of the pSCORE method for illustrating your storyline:\nPrepare any necessary handouts for your audience to read before, during or after your presentation. Split your storyline into paragraphs or points, and, for each part, work out whether your audience would benefit from a visual aid to help them understand and/or remember it. Where a visual aid might help, identify the most appropriate kind: a physical action, perhaps with an object; a video; a whiteboard or flipchart; or a slide. Sketch any slides you need on paper or sticky notes. Create a storyboard containing your sketches and clear instructions for your designer. Complete the pSCORE Slide Design Checklist* to ensure you are telling your designer everything they need to know. (If you are designing your own slides, this can still be helpful.) If the first version of your slides is perfect, great! If not, provide clear slide-by-slide instructions showing your designer what to change so the second version is exactly what you need. When you receive the second version, double-check that all transitions, animations and fonts look exactly as they should, and that you are comfortable delivering your presentation with these slides. By the end of the Illustration stage, you should have your story and slides, perhaps with some useful handouts, and you can move on to the Connection stage, where you will prepare to deliver your presentation to your audience. Like the Foundation stage at the start of the process, the Connection stage is often neglected or rushed, yet it can make the difference between failure and success.\nTo learn more about this and the other stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, get your paperback copy of Business Presentation Revolution from Amazon or any good bookseller.

In the Creation phase, you mix all these ingredients together using the art of storytelling, ending up with a compelling storyline for your presentation.\nThe key revolution here is that you need to create your storyline before you start producing any slides. Too many presenters move straight ahead and open PowerPoint, producing many slides but without thinking about what they’re going to say. Slides exist to illustrate what you’re saying: you’re not there to comment on slides.\nInstead, we’ll apply the art of storytelling. Even if your sales targets have nothing to do with fantasy or your product’s advertised features aren’t just a fairy-tale, storytelling is the most effective way to get your message across to your audience.\nStorytelling in business goes way beyond telling stories.\nThe first responsibility of every presenter is to keep the audience awake and fully attentive. If they are attentive, they are influenceable; and if they are influenceable, they can be transformed. The opposite is also true.\nYou need to produce an original presentation every time, and that means using the power of story to grab their attention at the start, maintain it all the way through and wrap everything up properly at the end.\nThere are three main aspects of storytelling in business presentations:\nStructure: think of your presentation as one big story, structured using storytelling techniques. Anecdotes: inside that big story, include smaller stories, examples and anecdotes to make your key messages stick. ‘Chocolate chips’: while plain cookies can be good, it’s the chocolate chips that make them especially enjoyable and moreish. In your presentation, include analogies, surprises, actions and other storytelling techniques to reset your audience’s attention and make your presentation more enjoyable. Here’s a summary of the steps to follow in the Creation phase, as explained in Business Presentation Revolution:\nSimple: After completing the Foundation and Ideation phases, create a seventy-word ‘elevator pitch’, answering the questions: “What? So what? What next?” This will help you identify your key messages and provides a good first draft of your conclusion. - What? What are the key messages they should remember?\n- So what? Why are these messages important to them?\n- What next? Now they understand what you are saying and why it is important to them, what do you need from them?\nClear and Related: Choose a structure that suits your objectives and the ABC of your presentation. Take the content ideas from your Ideation brainstorm and plug them into the structure you chose. Discard what you don’t need and fill in any gaps. Original and Enjoyable: If you wish, build in a concept or theme that makes the presentation more memorable. Include some anecdotes or examples to make your key messages stick and keep your audience’s attention. Wake up your audience and turn over the hourglass of their attention with a MAGIQ Moment: something you say, show or do that Makes A Great Impression Quickly. Use your elevator pitch as the basis for a conclusion that reminds your audience of your key messages, explains why they are important and relevant to them, and tells them what you want them to remember, believe, feel and/or do afterwards: the “What?” the “So what?” and the “What next?” If you have a big enough audience, prepare a powerful last line and finish with a simple “Thank you” to make them want to clap and to give them their cue. Prepare an introduction that creates an emotional reaction in your audience and makes them feel like they want to listen. Then, and only then, consider adding an agenda. Finally, make sure your presentation is a personal talk from you to your audience. If someone else could deliver it, or if you could deliver it to another audience, it’s not personal enough. Following these steps will put you way ahead of most presenters and ensure your storyline grabs their attention, and keeps it until the end, communicating your key messages memorably. This matters because attention leads to action, and only an attentive audience can help you achieve your transformational objectives.\nBy the end of the Creation phase, you should know what you’re going to say, and you should be confident it will allow you to achieve your transformational objectives. Then, and only then, you can start thinking about whether to illustrate your talk, and if so, what kind of visual aids might help your audience.\nTo learn more about this and the other stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, get your paperback copy of Business Presentation Revolution from Amazon or any good bookseller.

This means you need to find ideas, because ideas are the raw material of a successful presentation.\nAs we’ve already seen in previous chapters, your aim is not to inform but to transform your audience somehow: from prospects into customers, from skeptics into believers, from observers into actors, or perhaps from unhappy employees into happy, motivated contributors.\nImagine your audience on one side of a river, the ‘before’ side; your aim in your presentation or meeting is to take them to the other side, the ‘after’ side.\nYou are not going to just stand on the ‘after’ side and shout, “Hey, look at my great idea – come over here!” Unless your idea is truly fantastic, they’re not going to swim across to find you. It’s up to you to start from their side, provide the right stepping-stones to allow them to cross, and then guide them to your destination.\nToo many presenters fail to transform their audiences because they start from their own level of expertise and knowledge, and their wisdom goes over their audience’s heads. They are standing on their ‘after’ bank of the river, shouting into the mist about how wonderful it is, and have no idea where the audience is or whether they can hear or understand them. That’s no way to transform people.\nYou can’t take someone from point A to point B without starting from point A alongside them. And to do that, you need to know where point A is.\nFour steps to understanding\nThere are four simple yet powerful questions you can ask yourself to help you understand where your audience is before your presentation. In relation to your objectives, company, products, services, project, ideas, etc.:\nWhat do they know? This relates to relevant facts that they know for certain before your presentation.\nFor example, they may know the sales figures this quarter are 30% down versus last year.\nWhat do they believe? This includes things they think they know but which we cannot put in the ‘know’ section for one of the following reasons:\nThey are wrong. They aren’t sure. They are speculating about what might happen. They are making a judgment. For example, still using the example of a CEO of a 1000-person company:\nThey believe you will take a bonus despite the poor results (wrong). They believe you’ve been looking for an excuse to reduce headcount (unsure). They believe you will announce job losses (speculation). They believe the company strategy is crazy (judgment). What do they feel? This is their emotional state as it relates to your presentation, before you begin.\nFor example, they may feel demotivated, afraid, angry, frustrated or pessimistic.\nWhat do they do? This relates to actions they take.\nFor example, they may focus on selling big long-term contracts that don’t provide quick income, or they may accept long payment terms without negotiating, or they don’t collaborate effectively to boost sales.\nYou can answer these questions using the Audience Transformation Roadmap table, which you can draw on a board or flipchart. You can also fill it in on a computer or tablet (although remember that I recommend avoiding screens and computers while you’re trying to be creative).\nAfter you have worked out what they know, believe, feel and do before your presentation, you will answer the same questions for your audience after your presentation.\nNow that you have a clear ‘before’ and ‘after’ state for each of the four points in your roadmap and we know how we need to transform our customers, it’s time to plot how to make those changes.\nThis is where the middle column comes in: the Transformation Column. If you’ve drawn the Audience Transformation Roadmap on a flipchart or whiteboard, once you’ve filled in the “Before” and “After” columns, take some sticky notes and brainstorm ideas to fill in the Transformation Column.\nOnce you’ve filled your Transformation Column with sticky notes about how you can change what your audience knows, believes, feels and does, put these sticky notes in a logical order, like stepping-stones, and that will give you a first version of the structure of your presentation.\nThe Foundation and Ideation stages will set you up for success if you take the time to complete them; yet, most presenters don’t make the effort. If your objectives are worth taking time to present to your audience, they are also worth the preparation time. If you ace your preparation, you are likely to ace your presentation.\nYou can find more information about the Audience Transformation Roadmap here, as well as a downloadable template. You can also learn more about it in the TEDx talk below.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/06/18/2021-06-18-pscore_stage_2_ideation/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"pSCORE Stage 2: Ideation"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Business Presentation Revolution outlines the five stages of the Presentation SCORE Method, or pSCORE, giving you a simple, proven process to follow to prepare and deliver successful presentations every time.\nIn this extract from Business Presentation Revolution, author Phil Waknell outlines the vital first stage: Foundation.\nIf you build a house on sand, it will not be stable; likewise, if you start to prepare a presentation without understanding its context or its audience, you will be setting yourself up for failure. Even if you only spend a few minutes on your foundation, those will be the most important minutes you spend on your presentation.\nBy the end of the Foundation stage, you’ll have a clear transformational objective for your presentation and a good understanding of your audience, and you’ll be ready to begin thinking about what to say.\nStart With ABC The first step to reaching that point, though, is to forget about what you want to say. Put that to one side for now and focus on your audience, their burning needs and the context in which your presentation will happen – the ABC of presentation preparation:\nAudience: a clear and detailed understanding of the people who will watch and listen to your presentation. Burning needs: knowing what keeps these people awake at night, their problems and their objectives. Context: your context, the audience’s context and the context of the presentation itself. By focusing on your audience right from the start, instead of on yourself, you are laying the foundation for a successful presentation. As much as possible, try not to think of your audience’s needs through the prism of your own situation. You’ll have plenty of time to think about your own objectives and messages later in the process.\nTransformational Objectives Fixing the presentation problem and joining the Business Presentation Revolution does not only mean creating and delivering better presentations. It also means knowing when to present – and when not to.\nMost presentations fail because they try to transmit information, which is more effectively achieved with a written document. We forget most of what we hear very quickly. Oral presentations (with or without slides) are fantastic for inspiring, motivating and transforming audiences, but using an oral presentation to share information is like using a colander to carry water. While it is good for some things, this is not one of them. However, a presentation is an excellent way to change what people believe, feel and do. If you don’t change your audience in any way, then you’ve wasted your time – and, worse still, you’ve wasted theirs. To set your transformational objectives, simply complete this sentence:\n“After this presentation, the audience will…” Make sure the verb in the last part of the sentence is a ‘feeling’ or ‘doing’ verb. If you find yourself with the verb “know” (or something similar), ask yourself why they need to know this – and then complete the sentence again with the real objective.\nSummary The Foundation stage may not take long, but it is time too few presenters choose to spend. If you understand your audience, their burning needs and the context, and choose a few transformational objectives, then you are ready to start preparing your presentation. If not, you are shooting at an invisible target with both hands tied behind your back. Business productivity requires efficiency, but the Foundation stage is not a corner you can cut: it is the fastest path to success.\nFind out more about the Foundation stage, and the four other stages of the pSCORE Method, in the book Business Presentation Revolution, published in July 2021.

Audiences don’t appreciate speakers who haven’t prepared properly, don’t know their presentation well enough, and are visibly worrying about what to say next.\nThere are several simple actions you can take before your presentation to maximize your own comfort and help you to deliver a better talk. I call them the 3 S’s: serenity, space and support.\nSerenity Whether you prefer to improvise or learn your speech, you should rehearse it aloud several times, filming yourself if you can, and making sure you take no more than 90% of the time allocated for your presentation (not including any time for questions and answers). The fifth run-through will be much better than the first, and you will be more comfortable with the flow of your presentation and better equipped to react, adapt and improvise if needed.\nIf preparing your presentation is like mixing the ingredients for a cake, then rehearsing is like baking it. Most cakes are not edible raw, but you should not burn them either. Rehearse enough, but closer to five times than fifty. You’re aiming for a personal connection, not a perfect delivery.\nIn particular, rehearse your introduction and conclusion, even if you aim to improvise much of your presentation. The beginning is where you will feel the most stress, and where the audience will form an initial impression of you, so knowing how you will begin your presentation will give you the best chance of a strong first impression. Equally, knowing your conclusion well should make their final impression just as positive.\nYou should also prepare a cue-card: write a few words to remind you of the flow of your presentation on a small piece of paper to keep in your pocket. This way, you won’t worry about forgetting what to say – and because you will feel more comfortable, you’ll remember your flow more easily.\nSpace Familiarizing yourself with the place or online platform in which you will be presenting will help you feel more relaxed. Try to get access to the room, stage or application in advance so you are not discovering it at the start of your presentation.\nSupport The people handling the technology are your friends, as long as you seek them out in advance, ask them about any limitations and make sure they know what you need from them. For a presentation with a live audience, this means the microphones, lighting, sound and screen. For an online presentation, it means the people who will be responsible for the online platform, screen sharing, spotlighting your video and making sure only the right microphones are live.\nOnce these important people are properly briefed and on your side, you will feel ready and calm. Knowing that they have tested your slides in real conditions will give you one less thing to worry about.\nFind out more in this short video featuring our Chief Coaching Officer, Michael Rickwood, with host Rose Bloomfield.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/06/02/2021-06-02-how_do_you_prepare_yourself_before_a_big_presentation/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"How do you prepare yourself before a big presentation?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"I’m not a motor mechanic. I don’t play with my car’s engine, hoping to make it run better, because I don’t understand how it works in detail. I leave that to experts who are professionally trained and experienced.\nThe human brain is far more complex than an engine, and we know far less about how it works. Trying to present without learning a little about how the brain works is like throwing a spanner into a car and hoping it will fix the brakes.\nDon’t worry, I’m not going to get all neurological here. I’m just going to give you a few highlights about what presenters need to know. I believe this is required knowledge for giving presentations because when you present, you’re trying to change what’s in your audience’s brains in some way. The following points are my own conclusions based on reading many books and papers, as well as my own experience. If you need to see the science behind these simple statements, I recommend the excellent Brain Rules by Dr. John Medina and anything by Richard Wiseman or Richard Mayer.\nThere is no such thing as ‘divided attention’: there is ‘undivided attention’, or distraction. If you don’t have your audience’s undivided attention, they won’t properly understand or remember what you’re saying. Attention spans are short, even for interesting material, and almost zero for anything boring. When it comes to presentations, two synonyms for ‘boring’ are ‘typical’ and ‘predictable’. Human beings cannot simultaneously listen to one thing and read another. We forget most of what we hear, very quickly. The more we say, the less people remember. Business presenters need to know what science already knows about how their audiences pay attention and how they learn. Most presenters don’t work hard enough to gain or retain attention; they expect people to read and listen simultaneously, they don’t use memorable images, their presentations are too long and they usually say too much for fear of leaving something out.\nAll of this can be doubly relevant for online presentations. Where a live audience might be able to pay attention to their boss for twenty minutes, that attention span may only be ten minutes in an online meeting, where the speaker doesn’t know whether the participants are paying attention – and where the participants know that the speaker doesn’t know.\nA presentation is hard work. If the presenter doesn’t put in the hard work, it will be hard work for the audience.\nThis is an extract from Business Presentation Revolution, the new book by Phil Waknell, published 7/14/21.

Shorter, more personal, more visual and more memorable, we now have thousands of talks to choose from providing us with a learning platform as awesome as Wikipedia. Business has benefited from it in miraculous ways. Garr Reynolds, author of Presentation Zen, once coined a great phrase: the ‘Ted-ification of business presentations’. Thanks in part to TED, but also to a certain extent to the original presentations of Steve Jobs, we all benefit from simpler, clearer, more original, more relevant and dare I say it more entertaining business presentations. However, with familiarity comes contempt and the new normal brings challenges. There are two key points we need to remember when presenting in business: boundaries and context. There are thousands of dud TED Talks out there but even great ones have elements that can’t be replicated in a business setting. When I first started working in business 15 years ago here in Paris, most people practiced the approach of keeping their private life and their working life separate, sometimes so much so that most people took little interest in their day-to-day slog and reserved their passions for the evenings and weekends. Today the landscape is changing and I believe for the better as people bring their creativity into their white-collar work. But a delicate balance needs to be struck. What TED has encouraged is connection between speaker and audience, and this connection requires vulnerability, something that is celebrated at TED events. However, when presenting in business contexts, while encouraging transparency, inspiration, humour and warmth, you should avoid crossing the boundary into your personal affairs. I remember running a workshop at a major pharma company 6 years ago. I invited the participants to share some of their personal stories in the workshop as a speaking exercise. While some stayed within appropriate personal limits, others did not, and it slowly transformed into an exercise which was not appropriate for the context. After realizing the error I wound the session down gently. It’s true in TED that people share deeply personal things; in business however we need to be very selective. I notice this happening also on Clubhouse. This is often a place where business professionals congregate to exchange ideas, network and/or sell their consulting or coaching services in rooms devoted to business topics. But all too often the participants get too personal within those rooms, sometimes selling their skills or expertise on the back of deep traumatic pain, wearing it like a medal. Business presentations need to be effective, clear and have emotional appeal but business presentations and sales pitches really need boundaries. Another issue is not observing formality, particularly with language: the use of slang, profanity and over-familiar terms for example. You should also avoid content which isn’t appropriate for the context. Many different cultures and organizations will frown upon this. Telling a joke that doesn’t fit for a cheap laugh, or talking about your hangover, is not professional. What examples and analogies are you using? Are they appropriate? The context should also guide your slide design choices. If you are selling your services to Chanel or L’Oréal, I wouldn’t put cartoon characters on your slides. If you are presenting at the World Bank on the topic of developing wind farms in the Seychelles, should you be showing an image from Love Island to frame the context? I think a lot of what I write here is common sense, practiced by many business professionals, but post-TED does present new challenges for business. By all means use TED for inspiration and to see examples of powerful presentations, but when applying that to your business presentations, remember your boundaries, and take care to adapt to the context.\nWhen there is so much noise in our content-rich world, it’s all the more important to strike the right tone.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/05/25/2021-05-25-what_s_the_right_tone_for_business_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What’s the right tone for Business Presentations?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"There is no such thing as a perfect presentation. You should of course prepare and rehearse it enough so you know it well, and so your messages come from the heart, not the head. If you can focus on delivering not just the syllables of your words, but the meaning behind them, then you are ready to present. Do not overdo the rehearsals, though. Your audience does not expect absolute perfection, and if you can create a strong connection with them, they will accept your imperfections, and see you as more human. Focus not on trying to speak perfectly, but on making a personal connection with your audience, one member at a time.\nRemember: it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. Since communication is more about what they receive than what you send, it’s vital to build a connection with them, so they are part of your presentation, paying full attention, and truly listening.\nThis means you need to pay attention to them, and how they are reacting to your messages – and adapt your presentation accordingly. Aim to interact with your audience as much as possible, and to bring them into the communication.\nThe more you can make a personal, human connection with your audience, the more likely they will be to overlook your imperfections, and to want you to succeed – and the more attentively they will listen.

If your boss asks you: “Have you prepared your presentation?” what she really means is: “Have you prepared your PowerPoint® slides?”\nThis means that presenters automatically assume that they will use PowerPoint® slides, and do not even consider that there may be other possibilities.\nAsk yourself, for each point in your presentation: does my audience really need any visual aids? Don’t assume they do. I’ve worked on TEDx talks where a speaker has produced some very good slides, but when I’ve ended up convincing him that his audience doesn’t need them, and would do better without them. In my own TEDx talk, there are parts where I now think I’d have done better not to have slides on the screen. In most sales presentations, slides are just a barrier: it’s better to have a conversation.\nIf you decide that your audience will benefit from some kind of visual aids, you should then ask yourself whether you can use a physical action to illustrate what you are saying. This could mean doing something with your hands, or an object, like Steve Jobs pulling an iPod Nano from the smallest pocket of his jeans.\nPeople remember what you do far better than what you project, even if your slides are great.\nIf there’s no suitable object or action for this point, the next question should be: would a flip-chart or whiteboard (or similar modern media like smartboards or a Zoom whiteboard) be a good way to illustrate what I am saying?\nIf the answer is no, then and only then should you consider using slides. Since you are giving suitable handouts anyway (right?), you do not need to produce slides for your audience to take away. You only need them if they help to make what you are saying easier or quicker to understand, and/or more memorable.\nThe key with any tool is knowing when not to use it. If you only have a hammer, you’ll treat everything like a nail; if you assume you are going to use PowerPoint, then you restrict yourself to one illustration method when other choices may be better, and the right choice may be no visual aids at all.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published July 2021.

Whether it’s a psychological drama like American Beauty, a sci-fi movie like Star Wars or an action movie like Mission: Impossible, the same structure, plot points and character development techniques are used. I’ll just take one as an example: the hero, the main protagonist, is always an orphan, literally or figuratively, or experienced a personal drama; it is supposed to give the character more likeness. Luke Skywalker is an orphan. Jack Dawson, the hero from Titanic, leaves everything behind as a third-class passenger. Fin, the hero from Sharknado, is divorced.\nIf I mention the Hollywood formula for movies, it’s because people often ask me if there is a foolproof formula for a great talk. Well, just like for movies, there are elements which are in every great talk such as establishing a connection with the audience and bringing an original, thought-provoking point of view, and I will concede that sharks flying in a tornado! is more original than boat meets iceberg. But with the same formula, you may end up with one of most viewed talk of all time, or you may end up with a series Z talk. Why? Because things that are harder to qualify, such as experience, tone, style and taste make a world of difference to the end result. Lack of experience can lead to basic mistakes, bad taste can turn off your audience, tone-deaf words can hurt your credibility. So yes, there is much more to a great talk than a formula, which is why benefiting from the experience of seasoned coaches can make a huge difference.\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter if you end up with a Titanic or a Sharknado type of presentation, as long as it fits your goal and audience. Because, ultimately, your talk is for them, not for you.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021-05-18/sharknado-is-the-same-movie-as-titanic-only-with-more-sharks/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Sharknado is the same movie as Titanic, only with more sharks"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Slides can be an extremely powerful way of making your messages clearer and more memorable – yet all too often they are an obstacle to communication.\nHumans can’t listen and read different things simultaneously: we can only process one linguistic input at a time. So if a slide features a lot of text and detail, it might make a useful reference document, but a terrible visual aid. On the other hand, if you keep your slides simple, with only a few words, they’ll be good visual aids but worthless as handouts.\nSo most people try to do something in the middle, and end up with not enough text to make for a useful reference document, but too much for a visual aid. 50% slide, 50% document, 0% effective. This is often known as a “slideument” – and it’s as horrible as it sounds.\nWhen it comes to a presentation, it’s important to underline just how different slides and handouts need to be.\n1. Slides are for projecting; handouts are for printing\nFor the audience, slides exist only as light projected on a screen for a short period of time, and they should be designed to work well on a projector screen, a flat screen monitor and/or an online meeting platform. Handouts, on the other hand, need to be designed so they can be printed if necessary.\n2. Slides support an oral speech; handouts replace it\nGood slides don’t stop the audience from listening; great slides help the audience to listen even more. Handouts, on the other hand, need to be standalone, i.e. clear and easy to understand for someone who missed the live presentation, or who is referring back to the content long after they forgot what the presenter said.\n3. Slides are for looking at; handouts are for reading\nSlides should be visual, allowing the brain’s linguistic processing to focus almost entirely on what the speaker is saying. Handouts, however, are intended for quiet reading: as there is no speaker to listen to, the brain can focus its linguistic processing on the document.\n4. Slides feature only key words; handouts have complete sentences and even paragraphs\nVisual slides will only have a few big words that we can understand quickly, so the audience can keep listening to the speaker. Handouts may feature full paragraphs so the reader can understand properly without ambiguity.\n5. Slides often have dark backgrounds; handouts usually have white backgrounds\nGood slides will often have dark backgrounds to avoid tiring the audience’s eyes. Most handouts, however, will have white backgrounds to make them easy to print without spending a fortune on toner or ink.\n6. Slides should avoid ‘visual pollution’; handouts should feature meta-data\nItems like the page number, the date or the author’s name are ‘visual pollution’ when projected on a screen, distracting the audience from what they should be looking at; yet in a handout, they are positive and helpful.\nThe obvious conclusion is that slides and handouts are so diametrically opposed in their objectives and characteristics that you couldn’t imagine trying to do both with one file. Or could you? Take a look at some of your recent slides and ask yourself whether you fell into the slideument trap.\nI am often asked whether it’s acceptable to produce documents in PowerPoint. My answer: yes, as long as you don’t try to use them as slides, and as long as you share them as a PDF file. PowerPoint can be an excellent tool to produce visually attractive documents, such as proposals. At Ideas on Stage, we often produce document templates in PowerPoint for our clients. You just need to resist the temptation to project those documents: they are not visual aids.\nIf you are going to treat PowerPoint as a kind of Swiss Army knife, remember only to use one tool at a time. Trying to prepare a slide and a handout in one go will be as unsuccessful as trying to use the corkscrew and blade at the same time, except that the pain will be for your audience.\nThis is an extract from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published on July 14th 2021.

We see examples of it in TED, top company Keynotes and our favorite lecturers and leaders. Yet still there are things that need to be changed. I have tried to collect them into what I call the 5 negatives followed by our very own revolution solutions!\nNo foundations, people are still too last minute, whether its completing that 20,000-word dissertation at university written the night before or the finance report mixed together from excels and spreadsheets in the metro the same morning. I have seen plenty of TED talks where the speakers arrive to the event with an overlong and convoluted talk. Lack of decent planning leads to difficult situations and loss of credibility. It can also heighten anxiety. Not entirely surewhat this is all about? Neither will your audience be. Not putting them first will not yield the results you want, and if the objective isn’t clear in the first place then it’ll be doubly hard. Always take the time to know your audience needs and context. The solution is Revolution 1 – It’s not your presentation – it’s theirs. A to A. A to A means instead of taking your audience from A to B or A to C they don’t actually go anywhere. No one wants to sit in a car going nowhere. Telling your life story without actually giving us a reason why it’s meaningful to the audience will not impress anyone. Asking your audience to sit and listen to you without actually achieving anything or giving instructions will not either. Every minute needs to be meaningful. Align your objectives to their needs. The solution is Revolution 2 – Aim not inform but to Transform.\nAudience Glazed Eyes. We’ve all been there. Sitting through that dull plodding presentation with no interaction, nor variation or clear transitions. Rambling introductions that start and stop like an outboard motor and conclusions that fall off a cliff of silence. Storytelling is not just something we just say to children every evening, now we all need it. The solution is Revolution 3 – Create your story before your slides.\nDeath by persistently dense slides. We’ve all heard the old wives’ tales**.** No more than 5 slides per presentation, 7 bullets per slide, PowerPoint should be banned outright. In 2021 everybody still has an opinion. Communication has different mediums and visual slides and the written documents are 2 separate ones that each require different contexts. You can’t kill 2 birds with one stone trying to take a shortcut and ask the audience to read and listen at the same time, that will just kill your audience.\nThe solution is Revolution 4 – Don’t confuse slides with documents.\nPressure to be perfect. What’s theone thing behind most modern presenters anxiety? The raising of the bar of presentations from both the professional and the entertainment world. This has created a lot of pressure for the modern presenter, especially now much is being filmed and distributed online. Whether you are an executive, a start-up or an academic, being able to stand up and speak is an important career skill. But rest assured, no one can be better at you than you. So don’t compare yourself to others.\nThe solution is Revolution 5 – Aim not for perfect but personal.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/05/11/2021-05-11-what_are_the_few_big_things_we_need_to_change_to_fix_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"What are the few big things we need to change to fix presentations?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"As our recent LinkedIn poll showed clearly, the number one thing people hate about presentations is when the speaker reads slides to the audience.\nWhy does anyone still do this? If you show them all the text, they can read it far more quickly than you can say it, and they will wonder why you didn’t just give them a document to read instead.\nIf you are going to read your bullet-points, and then comment on them, be aware that while you are talking about point 1, they have finished reading all 6 points on your slide, and are switching off until you catch up with them.\nSo let’s make three things very clear.\nYour slides are not your cue-card, existing only to help you to remember what to say because you didn’t prepare properly. They are visual aids for your audience. Your slides are not a document, to be shared offline as well as shown during your presentation. If you need to share something before or afterwards, send a proper standalone document, not a set of incomplete bullet-points that could be (mis)understood in many ways. You’re not there to comment on your slides. Your slides exist to illustrate and reinforce what you say, so your audience can understand it more clearly, and remember it for longer. So we need to stop putting the cart before the horse. When we prepare a presentation, we first prepare the storyline so we know what we are going to say to the audience, and then we can ask ourselves whether, at some points, the audience will benefit from some visual aids. I invite you to throw away the idea that you need slides. By default, assume that your talk does not need slides, unless proven otherwise. Sir Ken Robinson’s famous TED talk, Do Schools Kill Creativity? uses no visual aids other than the images his stories create in our minds, and at the time of writing that is the most-viewed TED talk of all time.\nBut if slides are optional, a strong storyline is necessary. Prepare your story first, and then, if it will help your audience, by all means prepare some visual aids. You’ll be amazed how big a difference this simple process change can make. Often the smallest revolutions are the most important.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published in July 2021.

Many presenters treat their talk as if it were a dental appointment: their sole aim is to get through it as quickly and painlessly as possible, escape mostly unharmed, then drink something cool or strong, or perhaps both.\nOther presenters might say their aim is to share information: for example, to explain sales targets, or business results.\nIt’s important to dig a little deeper, and when it comes to objectives, the most useful word is ‘why’. Why are you explaining your sales targets? Is there perhaps something you want your audience to do differently? Perhaps just by knowing the targets they will behave differently, or feel more motivated to achieve them. In which case, you’ve changed them – and maybe that change was your real objective.\nMost presentations fail because they simply try to transfer information, which is far more effectively done via a written document. Experiments have demonstrated that people remember more of the information they read than the information they hear, as long as they have quiet time to read. So should you be presenting at all? If your sole aim is to move information between brains, then forget about an oral presentation: give them a written document and time to read it (and ideally a coffee too), and you’ll find that far more effective for everyone.\nHowever, a presentation is an excellent way to change what people believe, feel and do. If you don’t change your audience in any way, then you’ve wasted your time, and worse still, you’ve wasted theirs.\nYour objective is not to inform your audience, but to transform them.\nFor example, when Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, his presentation’s aim was not to share information – number of pixels, processor speed, etc. – but on one hand to create desire, and on the other hand to make people buy an iPhone, and write articles to recommend it. He wanted to generate feelings and actions. Of course his presentation included information, but only the information he required to achieve those transformational objectives.\nTo look at his objectives simply, if his audience had remembered all the iPhone’s specifications but did not want to buy it, would that have been a successful presentation? No. But if they forgot all the details yet still felt a strong desire to buy it, would that have been a success? Yes. So it’s clear that the objective is not transmitting information but generating transformation.\nYet far too many businesspeople still approach a presentation with the sole aim of sharing information. If you find yourself in that situation, ask yourself why they need this information and what transformation you aim to achieve. If there is no transformation required but you still need to share information, give them a proper document to read because that’s so much more effective than an oral presentation, and takes less of their time.\nThe world will be a better place when every presentation has transformational objectives, and when people share information in standalone documents instead of quickly-forgotten oral presentations.

Coach is one of my titles along with consultant, director, trainer and whatever else describes what I do, which is help people in all sectors and walks of life to give fantastic presentations in high stakes scenarios, or train them to be simpler, more natural, better prepared and highly impactful, whether on stage or on a digital platform.\nArtificial intelligence is all the rage these days, and last year Microsoft announced a new function in PowerPoint: The Presentation Coach. It’s an AI powered tool that helps you to rehearse and monitor your tone, keeps a word count tally per minute and will tell you off if you use too many filler words and profanity. After you’re finished it presents you with a dashboard telling you how you did, whether you need to improve or if everything was ok. After using it, I got a good score, but apparently I used too many fillers. The problem is: how do I tell a machine I’ve got an old motor tic problem?\nAdmittedly, like many people in many sectors, my first reaction to the idea of an AI doing the same job as me was dread. Is this the beginning of the end I said to myself? Already PowerPoint is proposing slide design ideas, now it can coach, what’s next? Is it going to deliver the presentation for you?\nIt’s true that if we take a wide angle lens view, the data doesn’t look good. According to McKinsey, 50% of all jobs could be automated by 2030, or at least 50% of the tasks that we currently perform. No industry will be spared, whether its industrial farming or yoga teaching. I don’t deny it, it remains a scary prospect for us all.\nBut what is clear to me, like in all sectors, is that we actually have a choice. Ignore it at your peril or embrace it and start using it to improve your offering.\nThink about life before predictive text? Or smart cameras on iPhones, or calendar apps? Hell, even dishwashers are smart nowadays. Augmented life is good.\nMy job is to listen to client presentations, brainstorm with them, look for contextual meaning in their messaging, find a visual story in my mind’s eye in order to help them produce slides, rehearse look for signs of poor concentration, anxiety and poor clarity. It’s true having a word count and feedback on whether they said the word ‘um’ 17 times is useful but frankly I’m ready to delegate this activity to a bot, hands down.\nJobs are evolving beyond our control and the boring stuff, the dangerous stuff and yes, all the stuff that a machine can do better and cheaper will slowly be removed from our job descriptions over time. So fight it, or work with it. We all have a choice. If I integrate this in to my rehearsals it will make for a better offering for my clients and provide me with an assistant that frankly doesn’t fulfill a job description for a real person. It also allows me to concentrate on stuff I’m better at.\nThere is one drawback, using this by itself might slow you down but it is not going to make you a better presenter. There is a risk that AI standardisation will alienate beautifully imperfect speakers. As with any AI, the tool can’t set the new standard and take away the humanity. And ultimately, it cannot give meaning and purpose to our words.\nSo, PPT Presenter Coach is here to stay. Using it will be useful, especially for me. I might have to toggle that anti-profanity option though, as swearing is apparently a sign of intelligence.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/04/27/2021-04-27-is-microsoft-s-powerpoint-presenter-coach-taking-my-job/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Is Microsoft’s PowerPoint Presenter Coach taking my job?

Everything was perfect: the products, the speakers, the locations, the scenography, the production. How proud Apple employees must feel today after such a great event. I have identified seven elements that set Apple apart from its competitors.\nCoaching. Get public speaking coaching. If you look at the video, the delivery of each speaker is impeccable: their diction, their voice, their posture, their body language. It always amazes me when I go, for example, to some top consulting firm only to be told, “Partners don’t need to be coached.” Here is the truth: most of your partners desperately need to be coached. Leadership. It is obvious, from the way the event is made, that Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple and main protagonist of the event, was heavily involved in its preparation. I will go further: the new format for the event was only possible because of Tim Cook’s leadership, sponsorship and direct involvement. While the event company behind it did most of the heavy lifting, ultimately Tim Cook took ownership of the result. Preparation. Something that most people will overlook is the insane amount of preparation required to reach such a level of perfection. If you decide to dedicate just one hour to the preparation of the event because you’re too busy, or worse, if you decide to just wing it, you will never make the cut for Apple’s event. Script. There was not a single boring moment in Apple’s event. Everything was well paced and fell into place naturally. Why? Because they took the time to build a detailed script in advance rather than throw stuff at the audience and see what sticks. Product. Each product is the best in its field, period. I know I am an Apple fanboy, but in the past I criticized the products that I found underwhelming (for example I still think the Mac Pro is an over-engineered and ugly mess, and let’s not talk about those $700 wheels). The event in itself is sleek, but what truly matters, the products, are insanely great. Quality. When we prepare an event, we often receive poorly filmed footage, shot in an untidy room, grainy and with terrible audio (background noise, low volume). While recent advances in image and audio treatment allow us to slightly improve the original material, there is no miracle: if you want your event look like a million dollars, it has to be filmed and recorded by professionals. There is no shortcut, but there is a final cut. Values. Say what you want about Apple, they put their money where their mouth is. The video included an excellent mix of people of different gender and ethnicity. I understand that the mix does not accurately represent Apple’s actual workforce and that some may find it unfair. It’s a question of choice and I think Apple does it right: you have to be the change you want to see in the world, or it will never happen. Speaking of values, it is good to see a high-tech company try to address the environmental issues it causes. However, Apple is far from perfect on that front, so I give them a C+ for effort. There is one thing that was missing from the event: naturalness. It was so perfect that you lose a bit of human connection. But I think that Apple’s objective has been attained: they have set an incredibly high bar for their competitors. In the late nineties, when Steve Jobs came back at the helm of the company, he imprinted his trademark keynote style on product launches. It literally took years for other companies to catch up (and copy Apple’s keynote style). This time, I’m curious to see how long it will take for companies like Microsoft, Google, Intel or Nvidia to adapt.\nI will end this piece with one thought-provoking question: how long will it take for your company to adapt?\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021-04-21/seven-lessons-from-apple-spring-loaded-event/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Seven Lessons From Apple's Spring-Loaded Event"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"When I visit companies to speak about presenting, I don’t give the same talk to every company. I don’t even give the same talk to every function in a company. They are all different, and while a standard talk would meet their needs, you should be more ambitious than just meeting their needs. You should aim to delight them.\nA presentation is a gift. You could just give everyone a pair of socks for their birthday. Would that make them happy? Unlikely. Likewise, personalize your presentation for your specific audience and they will be delighted.\nDoes it take more time to personalize your presentations to your audience? Yes. But it’s worth it. A standard presentation is equally irrelevant to every audience. If you don’t care enough about them to personalize your talk, why should they care about you and what you are saying?\nA personalized presentation will make a much better connection, and therefore has a much better chance of achieving your objectives. If you’re going to take your own time, and an audience’s time, you should at least invest that time well and give yourself a chance of success.\nThe audience is the first magic ingredient of every presentation. It should be prepared for them, address them specifically – and the part about you is only to show how you can resolve their problems, needs or desires.\nAfter all, it’s not your presentation – it’s theirs.\nThis article contains extracts from Business Presentation Revolution, by Phil Waknell, published in July 2021.

It brought the presentation revolution to a wider audience of enthusiasts. We propose to revisit five essential principles from the book that have stood the test of time and can still be considered as best presentation practices today.\nPlan analog. There are many theories that try to explain how creativity works, but one thing is sure. None of them advise you to get in front of your computer, launch PowerPoint and start hammering at your keyboard to add bullet points after bullet points. If anything, PowerPoint is going to kill your creativity and focus by distracting you from the essential. This is why Garr Reynolds and most creatives start their process with a pen and paper. iPad Pro with Apple pencil? Why not, but only if you are comfortable enough to use it effortlessly. Having to constantly break your flow to work out \u0026ldquo;how the hell do I do that?\u0026rdquo; is a sure creativity killer. Start with the end in mind. This simply means that before you start preparing, you should know exactly what result you expect from your presentation. This will help you sort out the content that must be included in your presentation from the content that can be left out. Remember that your goal should not be just to inform or entertain: ask yourself what is the change that you would like to see in your audience. Eat until 80% full. Many presenters tend to put too much stuff in their presentation. Why? Because this is what they learned in school: to give the most complete answers possible. And because they fear that otherwise their presentation will seem too simple or incomplete. But in presentations, complexity and data overload are your worst enemies. So, just as a good meal doesn\u0026rsquo;t overstuff you, resist the temptation to add those two extra slides that are nice to have but not indispensable. Use full bleed pictures to maximize their visual impact. The use of beautiful pictures that cover the whole slide is is something that has become a trademark of Garr\u0026rsquo;s presentations, and you should not hesitate to steal it! No other picture layout has the same impact, beauty and simplicity. Connect with the audience. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to sound \u0026ldquo;important\u0026rdquo; or like the teacher you had at school: it will only make you seem aloof and condescending, cutting the invisible but vital link with your audience. Instead, deliver your presentation as if you were having a conversation with a large group of friends. You will sound much more natural, authentic, and you will make people want to listen to you!

The task of gaining confidence while battling nerves and getting out in one piece is exhausting. Coaching, meditation, rehearsal, visualisation and psychotherapy are all strategies that professionals have turned to over the years to conquer the fear.\nHere at Ideas on Stage, we recognise the modern executive has no time and doesn’t wish to commit to self-help strategies. We also see many leaders who wish somebody else could deliver their presentations for them, but who know they have to be seen to be delivering the messages themselves.\nThis is why Ideas on Stage is proud and excited to launch a revolutionary solution: The Performance Buddy.\nThe Performance Buddy is a neural-engineered, brain-connected WIFI device which will allow the coach to take control of your body and voice, and present for you. Think of it like the film Avatar where the human controls the Naavi’s blue body from a distance. In this case, you are the blue body, controlled by one of our specialist presentation coaches.\nIt couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is to attach our amazing Performance Buddy to the back of your head and a relay emitter to your shirt lapel. Then one of our professional presenters, standing out of sight of the audience, will take over, walk your body on stage, and lend their expertise to articulate, gesticulate and speak convincingly with your hands, body and voice.\nIn short, one of our coaches will do the presentation for you while you observe from deep inside your subconscious: a calm, comfortable mind chamber we call The Buddy Zone.\nThis ground-breaking technology uses our patent-pending communication system: the Avatar Protocol for Remote Interactivity \u0026amp; Language.\nWe tested the Performance Buddy with several business leaders and one very well-known political leader, and while audiences noticed that they were more persuasive and less boring than usual, they never suspected that our Performance Buddy was behind their success.\nIn fact, the leaders enjoyed the experience so much, and gained so much time by not having to prepare their presentations, that they now use it all the time. Try it for yourself, and you’ll never think twice about handing the controls to one of our ace presenters who will drive you like a high-performance rally car.\nPlease note: all customers will need a full psychological evaluation beforehand and will need to sign a 65-page responsibility waiver in the event of a brain meltdown.\nYou’re probably wondering how much this amazing, revolutionary solution costs. The list price is $4,012,021, and this comes with unlimited presentations and technical support for a whole year.\nIf this is beyond your budget, but you want to learn more about effective presenting, our co-founder Phil Waknell is publishing a book this year: Business Presentation Revolution.

The numbers continue to rise, vaccines are rolling out slowly (here in Europe anyway) and governments and communities remain at loggerheads about what to do going forward. There is a general expectation that this status quo will continue to the end of the year and businesses are continuing to either postpone large in-person gatherings or are adopting alternative ones using the tools we have at our disposal.\nThe basic human need to get out there, see the world and meet each other has been put on ice. We still can’t even go and see a movie or dance around a handbag in a dark and noisy place.\nI sit here about to give my 30th webinar since the pandemic broke loose looking at a flat screen, remembering to look into the camera and keep my gestures visible, while seated or standing (which is better), wondering and hoping 2019 will come back. But the truth is, we know we can’t turn the clock back, and those who understand this are already making their way forward. The truth is, even once the virus has been beaten back we will still have THE underlying issue which is climate change. Governments all over the world are signing agreements to reduce emissions, and businesses are working to offset them or demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development goals. The bottom line is that until we have the commercialisation of planes that use other technologies to fly, business air travel via fossil-fuelled planes will decline. This, folks, is what they call the new normal.\nSo the world continues to turn. People need to connect, deals need to be made, ideas presented and strategies formed – but my goodness, there has to be a better way to get together than Zoom or Teams.\nSo, I don’t know about you, but this new normal, despite some advantages, could be seriously improved when it comes to connecting with others. So I decided to open the conversation here. What else can we do to communicate with each other apart from two-dimensional screens and earbuds to get us through the next decade?\nIn short: Virtual Reality. With rapidly accelerating connectivity, VR technology is looking increasingly strong. We at Ideas on Stage recently partnered with a VR firm using a headset to simulate rehearsals in front of a virtual audience with programmable responses. But this could go further in event participation, both as a presenter and as a participant. Consumer headsets such as Quest and Oculus-Go are not expensive, but prices rise quickly for more business-focused ones such as the HTC Vive Pro and Valve Index. Manufacturers are working to make these sets lighter year on year.\nApps/software that are appearing on the market to go with these things, like Spatial, Immersed, Glue and Engage to name a few, are offering some really cool experiences to get together in aesthetic environments with tactile tools to exchange and connect. For a relatively small investment and a manageable learning curve, every business professional can enter, I believe, into a more rewarding and intimate remote working structure. Not just for presenting but for collaboration and problem solving.\nAs I sit here and type this, I foresee great opportunities for this burgeoning market such as the desire to create made-to-measure virtual meeting landscapes and avatars. There are challenges too however such as compatibility over all platforms, a need for more sophisticated cybersecurity, the Segway factor (you can’t mix business and stupid avatars) and very importantly eye care. Working with a headset on all day will not be good for your eyes.\nOnline events and presentations will be transformed, and Zoom presentations, at least, will be a thing of the past. For presenters, content and delivery will always need to be on top form: as the experience improves, any sub-standard presentations will, by contrast, make an even worse impression than they do today. Technology always evolves faster than people do, so it will be up to presenters and meeting organizers to work hard to keep up and level up.\nAnd we will be there to help them.\nThat’s all for now: I have another Zoom meeting to go to…\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/03/30/2021-03-30-enough-with-presenting-on-zoom-already.en-copy/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Zoom"],"title":"Enough with Presenting On Zoom Already!"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means “a reason for being.” Ikigai is the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what you can be paid for and what the world needs.\nIf you ever want to speak at TED or TEDx event, you should find the ikigai of your presentation. It should be at the intersection of:\nWhat you love, or in the context of a presentation, what you really care about. What you are good at, so that you are legitimate to speak on stage. What you can be paid for, or in the case of TEDx, what you can be invited for. What the world needs, so that the topic reaches a wide audience. It is fairly close, yet different, to the three stakes that you should have in any presentation (what matters to you, what matters to the audience, what matters to people outside). By looking for the ikigai, you can avoid potential pitfalls such as\nFocusing only on your personal anecdotes or being too self-centered. Speaking about topics that are beyond your area of expertise.

After 4 exhausting years for America and the wider world, the page has turned from the failings of an introspective, corrosive and divisive mandate into a bold, courageous and reactive new era, acknowledging first the gravity of America’s collective problems and seeking to solve them through consensus and action.\nJoe Biden has his work cut out for him, that much is clear. Before doing anything however, he first needed to start it all off with the right speech. And on January 20th 2021, on the rear steps of the Capitol Building, President Biden gave an impassioned inaugural address to a domestic and overseas audience.\nAt Ideas on Stage, we have long worked with an understanding of audience segmentation based on 4 categories of people in your audience:\nAdvocates, those who are already aligned with you and who will promote your cause, Luke-warms, those who are broadly supportive, but may harbor some skepticism Skeptics, those who are not convinced but are more or less open to being convinced Hostiles, those who will never be convinced, no matter what you say, and who will advocate against you and perhaps even aim to sabotage. Let it be said that the aim of any persuasive speech is to bring the two middle groups of the luke-warms and skeptics on-side. Once you have the support of three out of the four groups, the hostiles will back down.\nIn this article I have chosen some passages that looked to win over the majority of Biden’s audience.\n“This is Americas Day, Democracy’s day, a day of history and hope, renewal and resolve.”\nThis is for every citizen who recognizes America’s democracy and values the freedoms it stands for. It is worth noting that there are hostiles who do not believe in democracy.\n“We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. There is much to repair. Much to restore. Much to heal. Much to build. And much to gain.”\nThis is designed to build momentum in those who recognize the perils and opportunities that surround them. The problem is then presented in no uncertain terms:\n“Few periods in our nation\u0026rsquo;s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u0026rsquo;re in now. A once in a century virus, taken lives, jobs lost, racial injustice, a cry of survival from the planet and white supremacy…”\nHe then moves to the elusive solution:\n“Unity, Unity.”\nThis points right at the heart of those who can put aside their differences and work for the country.\nTo help strike against doubt and demonstrate his commitment, Biden quotes Abraham Lincoln from the emancipation act quoting his words:\n“My whole soul is in it.”\nBiden goes on to say:\n“Today, on this January day, MY whole soul is in this: bringing America back together, uniting our people and uniting our nation. I ask every American to join me in this cause, uniting to fight the common foes we face, anger, resentment, hatred…”\nPowerful words again for advocates and skeptics alike. He then goes on to list the actions he will take to try to reverse the status quo, pushing collective empowerment, repairing alliances beyond America’s borders, again unity being the key word. His delivery is energized yet defiant.\n“Don’t tell me things can’t change.”\nHe then has a word for the hostiles:\n“And if you disagree, so be it. That’s democracy, that’s America. Yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. I pledge this to you; I will be President to all Americans.”\nBiden then lists the common needs of all Americans and none more important than truth.\n“Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders — leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the truth and to defeat the lies.”\nHe then finishes on service:\n“I will give my all in your service, thinking not of power, but of possibilities.”\nAgain, he looks to reassure his audience of his intentions and proceeds to congratulate every American who stood up for democratic principles, whatever their position on the aisle.\n“And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness.”\nThe speech was received warmly both domestically and abroad. Anyone caring about the freedom of American democracy cannot fail to be moved by these words, whether you’re an advocate, a luke-warm or a harsh skeptic. The hostiles no doubt will count themselves out and return to the hateful shadows as they have done throughout history. Like germs in an organism constantly buffeting against an immune system, hostile actors can never be eradicated completely and serve in future to keep democracy’s defense systems on their guard.\nWednesday’s inauguration ceremony at times felt like the end of a war, watching America breathing a collective sigh of relief, releasing suppressed humanity and inclusion.\nThe struggles remain, however, but progress edges forward, collectively, painfully towards tackling America’s problems more effectively, together.\nBut there is nothing like a good speech to get it started off though!\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2021/01/26/2021-01-26-biden-s-inauguration-speech-reversing-american-carnage/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Biden’s Inauguration Speech: Reversing American Carnage"},{"author":"Marine Bénard","contents":"\nZoom has become one of those tools that most people use, but how many of us have actually followed a training course on how to use Zoom properly? Not so many.\nAt Ideas on Stage we have been using Zoom for years, so when the 2020 pandemic hit, we didn’t discover Zoom, but we did start to discover new features: some that we hadn’t needed before, and some that Zoom introduced as its usage exploded.\nHere are some of the tips we’ve learned (often the hard way) on how to use Zoom professionally, and how to make online presentations using Zoom.\nBEFORE Set up parameters\nWhen you create your Zoom meeting, you have many parameters to choose from. For example, do you want to enable surveys? Do you want to enable live streaming to Facebook and/or YouTube?\nTwo of the most useful features are the waiting room, and automatically muting participants. If you don’t enable the waiting room, participants will just join at any time, and if you are running a webinar for example, you might want to allow participants in only after you’ve finished your testing. You may also choose, in this setting where there are many participants, to mute participants’ microphones automatically as they join; and in a separate setting, you can choose whether they have the ability to unmute their microphones.\nIf you are running a webinar, you will probably want to mute their mikes and not allow them to unmute them, to preserve sound quality. If, during the meeting, you would like to give a participant the opportunity to speak, you can go to the Participants list and ask the participant to unmute. Once you’ve requested it, they can activate their mike.\nThere are many other parameters to set. Do you want to automatically record the meeting? Should participants be allowed to share their screens, or annotate your shared screen? These are choices you need to make. Many of these settings are not in the ‘create meeting’ choices: they are in your account settings!\nPrepare surveys\nThere are many third-party tools to create surveys, but if you can use the one directly in Zoom, it’s easier for everyone. At the moment you can only create a survey in the web interface, so while you can do that during the meeting, it’s better to do so in advance. Simply go to the meeting page in your Meetings tab on the Zoom web site, scroll to the bottom, and add a survey.\nA real pro tip to remember here: when you launch a survey, display the questions and then display the results, these will show on your participants’ screens – but they won’t show up on YouTube if you are streaming live, so your streaming participants will be wondering what is happening unless you explain it orally very clearly.\nConfigure slides\nWhen streaming to YouTube, and (unless you change the setting) in your recording, if you share your screen, then your webcam video will be overlaid in the top-right corner of your screen. You should therefore avoid using this part of the screen because otherwise your face will hide some words or other content.\nIt’s also important to remember that on YouTube, Zoom will superimpose its watermark in the bottom-right of the screen, so it’s best to avoid using this part for anything important or text-based. Using the very bottom of the screen isn’t always good anyway, because anyone watching on YouTube and mousing-over the video window will find that their video controls will overlay over the bottom of the screen, hiding whatever is there.\nDURING Co-pilot / Mod\nAnyone who is familiar with streaming games on platforms like Twitch will know the importance of one or more ‘mods’ or ‘moderators’: people who aren’t speaking much if at all, but who are there to manage the participants, interact with them via text chat, and control or even expel them if necessary.\nIn business meetings, I prefer to call this role the ‘co-host, but it’s very similar. If you are the main presenter in a Zoom meeting, it’s very hard to speak and present well and at the same time manage recording, streaming, chat, muting or unmuting participant microphones, launching and hiding surveys, etc.\nIt’s therefore vital, in important meetings and webinars, to have a ‘co-host’ who can handle all these things, freeing you up to deliver your presentation with far less stress. Ensure that each ‘co-host’ is given this role (or the Host role) in Zoom so they have all the privileges to record the meeting, mute microphones, etc.\nSecond screen\nI have a home setup with my laptop screen and a second, external monitor next to it, and I extend my desktop so that, for example, I can move my mouse from one screen onto the next, and have different windows showing on each screen. This enables me to use PowerPoint with Presenter Mode, where I ‘project’ onto the second monitor, while seeing the time, my notes, the next slide etc. on my laptop screen.\nIn Zoom meetings, I can then simply share the second screen so participants see only what is on that screen. This enables me to show the Zoom chat window as well as other participants’ videos on my first screen even while presenting (currently this seems impossible in Microsoft Teams, where you can only see the video of the last person who spoke before you).\nIt’s a huge help. I couldn’t imagine presenting in a Zoom meeting with only one screen.\nSpotlight\nIt’s also very important, when one person is going to speak for some time, e.g. in a webinar, to ‘spotlight’ that speaker. This ensures that, by default, all participants will see that speaker’s video and not everybody else. It also ensures that on the video (if you are recording the meeting) that speaker should show up, and not the others.\nTo spotlight the speaker, a host or co-host simply goes to their name in the list of participants and clicks More, then Spotlight. The spotlight can be canceled in the same way.\nAFTER Edit recording\nIf you’re running a webinar, you probably don’t want to leave the raw video up there on YouTube. For one thing, you might not have the image rights from participants to share their voice and/or video online. You also might find that the intro, where you’re chatting with people while waiting for others to join, isn’t a great introduction to an online video.\nIt’s therefore wise to do some basic post-processing on your Zoom video. Hopefully you recorded the meeting locally, not on the ‘cloud’ (this gives better quality), so import this video file into your usual video-editing software, and cut the start and finish to make sure they look and sound right. You might also want to add an introduction card and another card at the end, so that when you upload your video to YouTube, you can overlay links to your other videos or playlists, and a subscribe button, at the end of your video – just as we have done on the video of this webinar.\nShare video\nIf you’re running an important meeting or webinar, you should also share the video with participants, including those who signed up but couldn’t attend. This gives you another opportunity to get your messages across, and since people forget much of what they hear quickly, it’s helpful to give them the chance to watch your meeting again.\nSharing the video also gives you a touchpoint with them so you can ask them for feedback, promote your upcoming webinars, or see whether they’d like to discuss with you one-to-one with a view to buying some services, for example.\nShare handout\nSlides are not documents, documents are not slides, and people forget most of what they hear in a meeting. It’s always important, therefore, to share a suitable document afterwards. For our webinar on Pro Tips for Zoom Meetings, this article is our handout. If you’re using Zoom for a business meeting, you may want to share a summary of the meeting and any decisions that were taken. If you’re using it for a training course, as we often do, you may want to share a detailed course workbook which gives them your full methodology, so they are not reliant on their memory if they need to apply your methods many months after your online course.\nThese are just some of the ‘pro tips’ we can share on using Zoom. Many of these are also valid in Teams or other platforms.

While this is fortunate and frankly would have been impossible 15 years ago it doesn’t come without its challenges.\nAs we struggle to maintain our routines, stay connected with our co-workers we have to continue the regular meetings attendance, trainings and webinars and we often have to give them ourselves. Online presenting is the new normal. From the conversations we’ve had with both our team members and our clients we’ve compiled a list of things to avoid when presenting online : a list of 7 sins. These 7 sins or not deadly, nor are they exhaustive. But it is a starting point in which we can make the experience of online presentations just that little bit less painful.\nSin Number 1 - Pointless Presentations Yes it’s true that pointless presentations hurt productivity in an office setting and online the hurt is no less painful. One question we can ask is, do we always need to be at every meeting? Here’s some numbers. In a large organisation the average employee can spend up to 10 hours per week in meetings, supervisors 15 hours. For senior managers the hours go up to 23 with nearly half of their week burnt up in meetings. About a third of that time is wasted on irrelevant conversations, meandering chit-chat and pointless presentations according to the MIT Sloan management review.\nNow, we’re not saying that meetings are bad, on the contrary, prepared and well organised meetings are empowering and good for community but too many meetings with pointless presentations kill morale and stifle productivity\nAt Amazon, they have a good approach to meetings which we call the 2/1/0 approach. 2 pizzas, 1 hard document and 0 PowerPoint. The pizza’s mean that no meeting should have more that the number of participants than two pizzas can feed. The singular document is distributed to every participate to read in silence for 10 minutes. The ensuing exchange will feature ZERO PPT slides. Ultimately, to choose between using PowerPoint badly, or not at all, you should leave the laptop closed. One controversial idea is to perhaps have less meetings and replace them with quiet time reading a document on your own, at one own pace. This would sit well with introverts for example.\nA good document should have 3 A’s. Autonomous, Accessible and Agreeable. Autonomous in the sense we do not need anyone to present it to us, it presents itself clearly with no corners cut on specifics and detail. Accessible means it should be divided into sections with a summary for quick navigation and Agreeable means it should be well designed with a consideration for colours, well-chosen fonts and visuals. Sin number 2 - Bad Slides Now most of us know how to do better slides today but for some reason, due to the emergence of many more online presentations, in my experience having attended as a jury member for many executive MBA and master’s programs, business pitch preparations, webinars and trainings, there is a tendency to want to go back to more traditional, heavy text presentations. This is a problem because the old issues of not being able to read and listen have gone away with video conferencing. The good news is that all our work with SCORE, Simple, Clear, Original, Related and Enjoyable still applies. Please check out our webinar on how to design great slides for online presentations. Sin number 3 - Disorganised Presenter So, imagine if I were to begin a webinar, log on 5 minutes late, in a dressing gown, so camera off, attempting to begin on mute only to be kicked off due to my bad WIFI? It happens more often than not. Working from home has its dangers so don’t allow ill-discipline to blight your work. Get on 15 minutes early, check your WIFI is working properly, your camera and sound. Get familiar also with your platform. There are many and due to various security issues companies are in constant flux about which ones to use. Sin number 4 - Background Image Filters It’s true, we can’t always be presenting from a beautifully designed room but throwing up a background image of something that is not remotely related to your task can be a visual distraction. Also, the filters don’t like erratic movement which causes outline issues. If you are regularly giving webinars Its better to invest in a real decor screen or otherwise a green which will give you a better definition when using a background. Just choose it to go with the context.\nSin Number 5 - Poor Interaction Keeping people engaged in online settings is even harder than in a live context so interaction is key. Imagine giving a 2-hour uninterrupted lecture on Zoom? People would be sleeping! That’s why structure is very important. Structure the webinar in advance. Variate activities and plan for time in working groups for collaboration. Also think about the kinds of activities you can introduce once the group is assembled such as quizzes, surveys and competition. This all helps to keep people engaged and ultimately learning. Sin Number 6 – Low Presenter Energy Monotony and online don’t mix. It’s a boredom cocktail. And in the words of Doctor John Medina, the author of Brain Rules, ‘The brain doesn’t pay attention to boring things’. You need to present like a radio host with lots of vocal animation and interaction. Give more energy than you think you need like a Youtube presenter gives 110% of their energy. Use the camera and look into the lens, articulate 110% and make sure your breath is well supported. Sin Number 7 – Bad Audience Now it might seem a little surprising here, but I wanted to shift the focus to badly behaved audiences. The people who never switch their camera on in business meetings, webinar attendees who don’t mute themselves, those who are clearly not paying attention and doing something else (careful you might get a question). Try to remain attentive (it’s hard enough for a host keeping the energy up via a screen) and watch out for home deliveries where you have to leave for several minutes and you miss something. So there you have it. 7 sins we’ve encountered with the heavy disruption of taking business communication online. Keeping it virtuous in the virtual on a daily basis, one webinar at a time, to make it a more effective and less painful experience for everyone. We hope it was useful, don’t hesitate to send us your ideas.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/12/04/2020-12-17-the_seven_deadly_sins_of_online_presentations/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"The Seven Deadly Sins of Online Presentations"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"Many of us are starting to approach presentations in the right way, taking the time to fix our objectives, analyze the audience, study the context, put together some coherent arguments, good visuals and even find the time to rehearse.\nJust as we are now spending longer to prepare our presentations properly, in a world of ever-increasing social media and ever-dwindling attention spans, our presentations are getting shorter in order to be more effective. What this means is that the inevitable question and answer interaction that follows is now more important than ever, yet we still don’t spend enough time preparing the Q\u0026amp;A session.\nIn this short article I would like to share with you 3 steps to Mastering Q\u0026amp;A: The Groundwork, The Message and The Dance.\nThe Groundwork At Ideas on Stage, when preparing presentations, we recommend that presenters begin with an ABC and analyze 3 things: the Audience, their Burning Needs and the Context of the presentation and its audience. This is a tried and tested approach to building solid foundations for the presentation and will also help you to produce the key messages and transformative objectives that you will also need to prepare your Q\u0026amp;A session. One thing that is necessary for your preparation is thorough research to feel confident in your answers. Prepare a list of the questions that are worrying you the most, and above all check the facts so you are thoroughly prepared. Your credibility on how well you cope with answering questions, so do the groundwork and lay solid foundations.\nThe Message The definition of a message is a one-sentence statement that incorporates two things: one of your most important points and one of your audience’s most important issues or values. An example here would be ‘Ideas on Stage has a decade of experience helping entrepreneurs to find the right formula to raise capital in a very competitive environment’. Something thing that sells us, and something that matters to them.\nFor entrepreneurs and small companies, it is reasonably straightforward to be in control of messaging but if we are part of a large organization where we are not permitted to say anything we want, many contextual aspects need to be taken into consideration such as hierarchy. That is why we use something we call the Traffic Light Technique. It’s a way to filter our messages between the ‘imperative messages’ (green), the ‘nice to have messages’ (amber/orange), and messages to avoid (red), as we take into consideration the structural hierarchy and risks that could undermine the organization as a whole.\nThe Dance This part of the process focuses on the soft skills of Q\u0026amp;A. Like in presenting, where we focus on direct audience contact and pressure, Q\u0026amp;A too comes with stress and risk.\nThe most important thing to remember is that it is your show, you decide when the questions start, you decide when they end and you choose the questioner each time.\nWhen choosing a questioner and giving them the floor, be mindful of some important things:\n1. First, listen actively, empty your cup of pre-emptive answers and listen to the questioner.\n2. Look for the meaning behind long and rambling questions by focusing on the cues in language such as the nouns and the verbs that they are using, all the while giving visual listening cues such as head nodding and showing engagement.\n3. Once you’re really sure of having understood the question, go ahead and answer. If there is still any doubt, you can paraphrase the question back to the questioner to seek their agreement to the question they’ve just asked.\n4. Whatever happens, always try to answer the question: avoiding answers doesn’t look good. You don’t want to be compared to a bad politician. Simply try to avoid any of the ‘red’ messages you identified, and aim to get across at least one of your ‘green’ messages in each answer. If you aren’t able to answer the question there and then, it’s best to admit it, and promise to get back to the questioner with an answer later. Nobody will want you to waste their time with a rambling statement that doesn’t answer the question.\nAccountability and transparency are highly valued by most business leaders, so practice your Q\u0026amp;A before the session to ensure you satisfy your audience and remove any doubt about your presentation.\nQ\u0026amp;A doesn’t have to be something that you don’t control. Take control and flourish as you finish the meeting as professionally as you started it.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/11/20/2020-12-21-how_to_master_q_a_sessions/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"How to Master Q\u0026A Sessions"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"A battle still rages for hearts and minds in the city built on speeches. Let the US election of 2020 be a lesson to all leaders of tomorrow.\nI am a frequent visitor to Washington DC. Having a key client on Pennsylvania Avenue, I have had the pleasure of getting to know the city and its people, working the day and socializing the night, breathing the atmosphere and drinking its politics. Washington DC is a city built on inspiration; it is built on speeches. There is a litany of references: Martin Luther King’s 1963 ‘I have a dream’ speech, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s inauguration (‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself’) and Ronald Reagan’s Challenger disaster speech… the list goes on. There are hundreds.\nRight now, in Washington, in November 2020, a battle rages.\nOn November 2nd, the United States went to the polls to elect a new president, and since then much of the world has been on the edge of its seat. At the time of writing, Joe Biden appears to be on his way to the White House, but the outgoing President Trump is not accepting his loss.\nI’d like to touch on two important speeches we’ve heard from these candidates: the acceptance speech given by the President Elect on Saturday November 7th, and a press conference given by the incumbent on Thursday 5th.\nFirstly, let’s look at Trump’s speech. On the Thursday after election night, and after briefings from his top advisers, Donald Trump took the decision to double down on the integrity of the vote. In the words of many of the covering networks, “He had sunk to a new low.”\nDuring the address, the President’s delivery style was firm and indignant, rebuking the result. For anyone who is ignorant of more than two centuries of elections in the US, this could perhaps be a convincing display as most people will not take a closer look at the detail. But reading through the transcript there are deeply unsettling elements. He began starkly with the accusation that his opponents were trying to steal the election, and what followed was a staggering slew of falsehoods that had some seasoned media pundits at the time of broadcast in tears. In the canon of presidential addresses, it will go down as one of the most toxic pieces of discourse ever given by an occupant of the Oval Office. A dystopian medley of projection, conspiracy and confusion, a nit-picking of grievances and alternative facts. Any audience listening to this, whether for or against this candidate, is left feeling triggered, troubled and weary. The objectives: to cast doubt, to destabilize and to discredit.\nFor many supporters of Joe Biden and the sober Trump voters looking for certainty, Biden’s acceptance speech provided some tonic.\nFirstly, by recognizing the presence of personal friends and family, he then widened the lens to the rest of the country, and within minutes he spoke of unity, of bringing together opposing sides, of improving America’s international image and championing the people who will help him in realizing his vision. His delivery was lively and animated, looking and sounding like a man younger than his 77 years. “Let’s give each other a chance,” he told Trump’s supporters. Decency, fairness and science were words he highlighted.\nThis is a world away from the list of Trump’s personal grievances. It’s a fundamentally non-violent, optimistic tone, seeking to calm and heal its audience, channeling partly Obama and partly Reagan, and for those who wish to see the country united rather than divided, this is a welcome return to the America we knew before.\nAt a time when Covid-19 rages on with 10 million cases in the US alone, a change in tone won’t be enough, but it may help to create the conditions for Americans to work together to beat the pandemic.\nWhat about communication in business? Violent communication in all its forms will, over time, break the spirit and burn out the listener. Poor leadership in communication, inconsistency, threats, half-truths and bluffs will destroy trust in your teams and will alienate partners. Most business leaders know this, which is why every organization works hard to groom the right senior communicators. But Trump’s style will leave its mark on the world, and the tone of violent communication will trickle down through every organization and business for years to come.\nWhichever company or organization you work for, successful leadership empowers your system and its people. Let this battle of violent-non-violent communication be a lesson for all future leaders: inspire respect, not fear; foster connection, not division; and build your people up instead of burning them out.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/11/12/2020-11-12-violent_communication_versus_non-violent_communication-_a_battle_still_rages_for_hearts_and_minds_in_the_city_built_on_speeches-/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Violent Communication versus non-Violent Communication"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"If you ever talked with me about my favorite TEDx talks, then I am sure I mentioned the late Hans Rösling, one of my all-time favorite TED speakers. On paper, he didn’t really start with an advantage; he spoke English with a strong foreign accent, and his key topic was statistics and demographics, something most of us associate with good sleep, not with great presentations.\nYet, Hans’ enthusiasm and passion on stage, combined with his unique way to use numbers to tell meaningful stories, meant that his presentations were always a high point of any TED conference.\nHowever, few people know that everyone can use the same tools as Hans Rösling for free. They are available on the gapminder.org website, and all you need to do to use them in a presentation is to give proper attribution. For example, I recently used gapminder.org to create a map of the world showing how the population living in cities doubled in the last forty years. Saying a number is one thing, but being able to see that number as a clear animated infographic is much more efficient.\nGapminder.org is going to give you the initial material, the starting point: the data and the animated infographics. But Hans’ killer skill apart from other statisticians is how he used data to tell meaningful stories.\nHans’ secret was that he didn’t talk about numbers, he used number to illustrate the stories he told.\nTake for example his fantastic talk about the evolution of India and China. He is not showing historical data about China and India (and the rest of the world). What he actually does is tell the story of how key historical events and the march towards sovereignty of these countries affected their development. Check in particular how he ironically talks about China’s great leap forward with central planning, and you actually see a huge drop in life expectancy.\nAmong Hans’ other skills: setting up the context to make sure that people have the necessary information to understand his story. He takes time to explain the historical context, and takes great care to explain the meaning of each element of his graph: each axis, the bubbles, the year, etc.\nHans is so popular that TED has a list of his best talks on their website. If you work for a large organization such as the World Bank, the AFD or the OECD, I highly recommend that you steal some of Hans’ magic.\nImage : CC BY 2.0, Pierre Omidyar, Wikipedia\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/10/20/2020-10-20-unleash-the-hans-ro%CC%88sling-in-you/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"Unleash the Hans Rösling in You"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Some people think that to make a great TEDx presentation, they should learn their text by heart. Our collective experience as coaches shows that it’s a good solution only IF:\nYou like to know your speech word for word and it fits your personal style and you know how to do it properly. If you don’t meet one of these conditions, then it’s best to avoid learning your text by heart. Why? Because it will appear awkward, unnatural or insincere. Reciting a text from memory requires a lot of effort, often at the expense of naturalness and emotion. To keep people close to your heart, don’t learn by heart.\nBut why if you want to do it anyway? Our advice is to learn it to perfection. You must practice until you can recite the text without having to think; only then will your brain be free to connect with the audience and express emotion again. Doing so takes a lot of time; the speakers who learn a text by heart and deliver it successfully on stage spend up to 40 hours just rehearsing.\nThe alternative we recommend for most speakers is to perfectly memorize the key points of the storyline, and use improvised, natural sentences instead of pre-learned ones. It is a much more accessible approach which delivers great results. You will still need to spend time rehearsing, but much less than if you tried to learn everything by heart.\nOf course, there is an exception. Sometimes, it’s absolutely necessary to say something exactly as it was prepared. It may be a very important statement in a public relations setting, a famous quote, or key marketing messages. In that case you should take the time to memorize those lines word for word.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020-10-06-should-i-learn-a-presentation-by-heart/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"To learn or not to learn your speech by heart"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Many speakers tend to rush the start of their presentation. During conferences and events, they start to speak even before they put a foot on the stage, talking as they walk towards the center, or as soon as the master of ceremonies stops to speak. It makes them look as if they think they are suffering from the “imposter” syndrome, insecure and unsure that they should be speaking on stage.\nConfident leaders act differently. They take the time to gain “ownership” of the stage. They enter the stage, fast or slow depending on their style. They use eye contact and body language to build a relationship with the audience. They take the time to position themselves in the centre, they take the time to breathe, and only then they start to speak. In other words, as true leaders do, they dictate the pace. Powerful people only speak when they are ready and on their terms.\nTaking your time before you start speaking will help you build more stage presence and avoid one of the most common pitfalls which is to start your delivery before establishing a proper connection with the public.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020-09-01-dont-rush-your-start/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Don’t rush your start"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Do animations in a presentation make you feel seasick?

Before, during and after the meeting, the facilitator’s role is key to ensure harmony, allow each participant to contribute, and achieve the meeting’s objectives.\nThe role will depend on the type of meeting. For a webinar, the facilitator will need to focus on sound quality, ensuring those not speaking have muted their microphones (or doing it for them), and handling the text chat. For a decision or collaboration meeting, the facilitator will need to ensure everyone has the chance to speak and be heard, focus on the meeting’s objectives, and keep a careful eye on the time.\nThere are several key responsibilities that the facilitator needs to cover, before, during and after online meetings. They may delegate some tasks to others, or they may decide certain tasks are unnecessary, but that should be a conscious decision, not an omission. Here is an overview.\nBEFORE\nTECHNICAL SET-UP: This means booking the meeting using Zoom, Teams, Hangouts or whichever system you choose to use, configuring it appropriately for this meeting, and ensuring participants have the sign-in details. ATTENDANCE: The most important task of any facilitator is to ensure all the right people attend the meeting. This means sending the invitation well in advance, sending a reminder a day or two before the meeting, and ensuring all participants are aware their participation is required, not just optional. PRE-READ: Remembering that we use documents for information and slides for attention (Revolution #4), it may be helpful to share some information in a standalone document before the meeting. If you are not going to allow time during the meeting for participants to read the document, you should also make it clear that they are expected to read it in advance. Pro-tip: send them another invitation for a 15-minute slot before the meeting so they have time blocked to read the document, and a reminder to do so. SLIDES: Even if nobody needs to give a presentation (and you should avoid presentations in online meetings unless they are the best way to achieve an objective), you may find it is helpful to use some ‘structure’ slides to remind people of the agenda regularly, to ensure nobody feels lost during the meeting. You might have the agenda engraved in your mind, but most participants will not, so sharing that regularly can be helpful for them. DURING\nTIMEKEEPING: Meetings should not overrun. State at the beginning that you are (or a designated colleague is) the timekeeper for the meeting, and that person will need to keep things on track, stop people if they are speaking for too long, and do what it takes to ensure the meeting finishes on time. This will make people feel less unhappy about being interrupted because everyone likes meetings to finish on time. INTERACTION: Most online meeting systems have a Chat function, and the facilitator should keep it open to respond quickly to anyone asking questions or making comments. It’s also possible to use it to chat privately with individuals, which may sometimes be helpful. The facilitator may also be the one to handle polling questions, and mute participants who fail to do it themselves. Most importantly, except in a webcast or webinar situation, the facilitator should ensure everyone who needs to speak has a chance to be heard, focusing especially on less assertive participants and inviting them to speak, rather than letting the usual loudmouths dominate the discussion. In particular, a good facilitator should not impose their own views: it’s therefore often best to choose a ‘neutral’facilitator who can focus on gathering everyone else’s opinion rather than trying to convince everyone to accept their own views. OBJECTIVES: The facilitator should always keep the meeting objectives in mind. This may mean bringing the conversation back on topic if it goes off on a tangent, and reminding participants regularly about the objectives and the planned agenda. Finally, the facilitator should ensure the meeting concludes with a summary of what was decided (if it was a decision meeting), or the key messages (if it was a webinar), or the main outcomes (if it was a team or collaboration meeting) – and in all cases, what the next steps are, if any. AFTER\nSUMMARY: The facilitator’s role does not end when the meeting concludes. In most situations, the facilitator should send some kind of summary to participants and to other interested parties, explaining what was said, what was decided, and what happens next. When it comes to decision or collaboration meetings, this has the added benefit of allowing people who are interested in the outcome, but not required in the meeting, to skip the meeting while still staying in the loop. This makes them more productive, and this kind of meeting will run better with fewer participants, so everyone wins. Even in a webcast or webinar, participants will likely forget what was said quickly, and sending slides is of no help to anyone, so a simple summary document – like this one, written to follow our 5th Virtual Meeting Revolution webinar – can be very helpful for participants. Based on these important responsibilities, several points will doubtless become clear to you:\nMost online meetings don’t have facilitators - and that’s one reason they fail. It’s most helpful when the facilitator isn’t the one doing most of the speaking. If you are speaking in a webinar, and sharing your slides, it’s hard to check the chat, activate surveys and keep an eye on the time as well. Physical meetings should also have a facilitator - not necessarily the most senior person present, but someone empowered to lead the meeting properly. Being a good facilitator is not easy: it’s an important role, which takes time and effort, and a good knowledge of the virtual meeting technology you are using: the facilitator is also real-time technical support to participants. Before 2020, I was often on stage in the role of Master of Ceremonies at conferences, performing a similar role. In the post-Covid-19 world, I’m expecting the role of Online Master of Ceremonies to keep me just as busy, as companies realise that they need a specialist to handle this role for important online meetings and conferences.

PowerPoint isn’t the problem - it’s how people (mis)use it.\nIn fact most business meetings would do well to avoid slides - and presentations - altogether. Meetings should be for discussion, connection, decisions… not for information-sharing. Using a wonderfully-crafted PowerPoint deck to share information is like using an iPad Pro as a frisbee: sure, it’s well-designed and better than most other tablets, but it’s still the wrong tool for the job. Just give people a document with full sentences, and time to read it. Far more effective.\nWhen it comes to online meetings, however, slides can be especially useful. Virtual Meeting Revolution #4 states: Use documents for information, slides for attention.\nFirst of all, this means you should use a real document to share any information the participants need. You might summarize some key points in some slides to show during the meeting, but this should just be a reminder, not the main source of information. Showing stuff in bullet-points during a meeting is not a“proof of communication”: it’s evidence of poor communication unless the information was shared properly elsewhere.\nSo what do you use slides for? Attention. Gaining participants’ attention, keeping it, and directing it.\nThe usual slide success criteria apply, so we can borrow these from our bestselling Business Presentation Revolution course:\nSIMPLE: One simple question or message per slide, easy to understand in five seconds CLEAR: Every element on your slide is easy to read/see at the back of the room ORIGINAL: Stand out, be different, and make people feel a sense of discovery with every click RELATED: Your slide must be related to what you are saying right then - not before or after ENJOYABLE: Well prepared, pleasant to look at, and worthy of your company’s visual identity In fact, they are even more important in online meetings. If slides are for attention, then they are vital because it’s very hard to keep people’s attention when you can’t see them, and they know you can’t see them. (Video meetings are great but too many people don’t switch on their video, and when you’re sharing your screen/slides, usually you can’t see everyone. And they know that.)\nThis means that you need to make an extra effort to make your slides Original and Enjoyable. If people like what they see, and get an emotional reaction from it, they will be less likely to switch their attention to something else. And ensure everything is Clear: they may not be sitting a long way from the screen like in a physical meeting room, but they might be watching on their smartphone, so if your text or numbers aren’t clear on a phone-sized screen, they’re not clear enough.\nThere are some additional points to bear in mind, though, which are specific to online meetings. Here are three things to avoid, and three things to use in virtual meetings.\nAVOID TRANSITIONS AND ANIMATIONS: Even a basic dissolve transition does not always look good in online meetings where the screen refresh rate is not as good as it is on your own screen. By all means have things appear at the right time on your slide using the Animation function in PowerPoint, but only use the Appear animation so the participants don’t see a failed attempt at movement, or zooming, or fading (and definitely no bouncing). AVOID SOUNDS AND VIDEOS: For the same reason of poor screen refresh rate, and the added reason of sound quality issues, avoid showing videos in online meetings. They’re great if you’re in the same room (although I usually avoid video if the room uses ClickShare which also suffers from the refresh rate issue, meaning video seems jerky), but not good online. Don’t use sound effects either. Also, this should go without saying, but please: no animated GIFs! AVOID GRADIENTS: Gradient backgrounds can look very good on your screen: this is where the background fades from one color at the top of the screen to another at the bottom, for example. When you share your screen online, what the participants see is often a lower-resolution version of your slides, with lower color definition. This means that what you see as a smooth gradient may be seen by others as a series of horizontal bands. It doesn’t look nearly as good. Best to avoid gradients in online meetings. USE STRUCTURE SLIDES: It’s important to use your slides to ensure participants are not lost. Let’s be honest, some people might get distracted by an important email, or phone call, or child, and miss a few minutes of your meeting. Don’t let them get lost. Ensure that you regularly show a slide that gives participants the meeting agenda or structure, and highlights where you are now. Even if you’re just sharing the agenda and then discussing for 15 minutes without advancing the slide, this can be useful: it’s the equivalent of having the agenda on a flip-chart in a physical meeting room, and it can help to focus participants’ attention. USE ANNOTATIONS: You can’t use a laser to point to a part of your slide as you would in a meeting room, but there are even better tools available. You can use the native PowerPoint tools to highlight things, outline them etc, and some online systems like Zoom also give the presenter some controls to use a highlighting function. Experiment with them to see what works for you. USE VISUAL PAUSES: We love black slides so much we call them The World’s Best Slide. In a face-to-face presentation, just inserting a simple black slide is like a visual pause, as if the screen or projector is temporarily switched off and the audience can focus right back on the speaker. You don’t always need a slide to illustrate what you are saying. However, in an online meeting, if you show a pure black screen, people will think there’s a technical problem. You may choose instead to use a mostly blank slide with just your logo in the center. Or you could simply pause your screen sharing so people see you speaking instead of your slides, until you need the slides again. After all, the most important visual of all is you, with your expressions and gestures. Always remember that slides are there to illustrate what you are saying, and to make it clearer, more meaningful and more memorable to the audience. You aren’t there to comment on slides, so always work out what to say before you think how you might illustrate it - if you need illustrations at all.\nIt’s only the meeting that’s supposed to be virtual; if their attention is virtual too, your meeting is probably just a waste of time. So we hope that if you follow this advice, you’ll be able to communicate effectively, and keep your audience’s attention throughout your online meetings.\nIf you need help producing effective slides for your online meetings or presentations, contact us using the form below, and our experienced PowerPoint designers will be happy to hear from you.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/04/10/2020-04-10-how_to_use_slides_effectively_in_online_meetings/","summary":"","tags":["Remote","Meetings","Slides","SlideDeck","Virtual Meeting"],"title":"How to use slides effectively in online meetings"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":"As many of us are learning, it’s easy to arrange a virtual meeting, but not so easy to run one successfully. There is quite a steep learning curve.\nOne vital area to work on is speaking in virtual meetings. People often complain of video issues, microphone issues, poor vocal expression, monotonous speakers, and poor interactivity. Step 5 of our Virtual Meeting Revolution process is called Connection for a good reason: when speaking in an online meeting, you need to connect with the other participants, and you can’t connect if they are so bored they are not paying attention, or if they gave up trying to understand what you are saying.\nBeing an engaging speaker in an online meeting requires three main elements:\nComfort: preparing yourself and your setup so you feel serene and fully focused, ready to give the participants and their questions your full attention\nPassion: speaking with energy so that people are engaged, and want to keep\nVariation: using your voice to engage instead of bore the other participants\nLet’s take a look at each of these elements.\nComfort If you seem comfortable, the other participants will feel you are in control, and this makes it more pleasant for them to listen to you. Nobody listens to a speaker who seems uneasy, agitated or poorly prepared.\nSeeming comfortable is good. Feeling comfortable is even better.\nStrong preparation before the meeting will help you to feel comfortable. This includes rehearsing any presentations aloud and timing yourself to ensure your meeting doesn’t overrun, and checking that your network, microphone and camera are working, and you have more than enough battery for your PC.\nAlso, the chairperson and any presenters should avoid coffee: it increases anxiety and will speed up your vocal delivery while drying your mouth and throat. A glass of water is your friend; just don’t spill it on your computer!\nNext, here are some tips to appear more comfortable.\nIf you can, try to speak in a standing position: this is good for your breath and the clarity of your voice, and it gives you more energy and freedom to use gestures. You’ll seem more in control – as long as you stand still.\nAdjust your camera location and angle so your eyes are two-thirds up the screen, whether you’re sitting or standing, and try to ensure the camera is more or less at eye-level. During my recent Virtual Speaking Success webinar (see replay below), I chose to sit down because in my home setup it wasn’t easy to get the camera at the right height for me to stand. Sometimes that’s a limitation you have to live with, so get used to speaking in either posture.\nTry to look into the lens as much as possible. To make this easier, if the technology allows, you could reduce the number of participant video windows so that you only see the active speaker, and you can reduce the size of that active video and move it to the top of the screen just underneath your webcam.\nPassion Boredom is contagious; luckily, so is passion. As chairperson or speaker in an online meeting, you are like a radio host. So how do you capture the passion and energy of a radio host? The first and most important thing to do is to keep the meeting objective in mind, and visibly care about reaching it.\nPassion also needs engagement from the presenter or chairperson, answering questions and keeping people’s needs constantly in mind.\nAnd finally, passion needs positive emotions: smiles and animated facial expressions help to keep people engaged. While minimal hand gestures are useful, they won’t always be visible on camera, so the main gestures to use are facial expressions (affect displays). If you look bored or seem like you don’t care, don’t expect anyone else to care either.\nVariation The most important element to chairing and presenting in virtual meetings is your voice. Monotony kills attention. So do overly long sentences. Keep sentences short, and finish each sentence on a downward inflection or tone, with a pause, so it’s clear the sentence is finished.\nTo avoid sounding monotonous, you can vary your speed, your tone, your volume and your emotion, even within each sentence. You might also consider trying out the Four Tempos of Vocal Impact:\nBright (short vowels and light vocal intention) Human (long vowels and light vocal intention) Bold (short vowels and Strong vocal intention) Captivating (long vowels and Strong vocal intention) By experimenting with these tempos, you can vary the way you deliver. A recent example is from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo: when he’s aiming to calm and reassure his citizens he uses the Bright and Human tempos, and when he is criticizing others and defending himself he uses the Bold and Captivating Tempos.\nYou can hear examples of these Four Tempos in our Virtual Speaking Success webinar (see below).\nTo sum up:\nCreate your Comfort zone with good preparation, and check your equipment and environment. Avoid coffee if you need to speak, and look into the lens to maintain eye contact with online participants.\nDiscover your Passion by adopting a Radio Host style, connecting to your objective, showing you care, and interacting regularly with participants to maintain their attention.\nBuild Variation into the way you speak, and shorten your sentences.\nYou can find more details on speaking in virtual meetings in the webinar below, and if you find this useful, check out our other* Virtual Meeting Revolution webinars* and don’t hesitate to contact us if you’d like help to prepare your next online meeting or presentation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/04/06/2020-04-06-virtual_speaking_success_effective_communication_in_online_meetings/","summary":"","tags":["Meeting","Remote","Virtual Meeting Revolution","Public Speaking"],"title":"Virtual Speaking Success: Effective communication in online meetings"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"What are you going to do today? For many typical office workers, the answer is: too many meetings, and not enough time to work. It’s rare that meetings and productivity coincide.\nAt the time of writing, many of us are required to work from home, so physical meetings have become virtual meetings, and they’re not always an improvement. Online meetings present their own set of challenges, principally because unless everyone has their camera switched on, one participant won’t know whether another is paying attention, or is checking Instagram, or has gone to walk his dog, aiming to return at the end of the meeting in time to say goodbye and pick up as few actions as possible.\nSo here are the 5 main revolutions our virtual meetings need to become real successes:\n1. Match the people with the purpose.\nEnsure the right people are there to achieve your purpose - and only the right people - while ensuring your stated purpose suits the people. Sometimes you’ll choose the meeting objective based on the people who should attend - for example a defined team - and sometimes you’ll choose the participants based on the objective. Always first understand the context, and then ensure the people match the purpose.\n2. Don’t pollute meetings with unnecessary presentations.\nOf course, at Ideas on Stage, we live and breathe presentations - but we’ll be the first to say when you shouldn’t be presenting. We like the Jeff Bezos approach: in a meeting aimed at decision or collaboration, there should never be any presentations. Not just no slides, but no presentations. Give people a document to read that includes any information they need, then focus the time on discussion and interaction, with strong facilitation (see #5). If you’re giving a webinar or webcast, that’s when a presentation can work well. In other meetings, plan to spend time on the other possible ingredients of a successful meeting: discussion, interaction, brainstorming and quiet reading (see #4), and only use short presentations when necessary.\n3. Aim for attention and interaction.\nAttention is the currency of leaders - and in online meetings, it is all too rare. Plan your virtual meeting to ensure people can find nothing more interesting to do… because the meeting is the most interesting thing they could do. It’s not up to the participants to make an effort to pay attention: it’s up to the meeting leader, facilitator and any presenters to make an effort to deserve their attention at all times. Planning for interaction is a great way to keep people engaged.\n4. Use documents for information, slides for attention.\nPeople forget what they hear very quickly. They remember far more from what they read - as long as they are allowed to focus on reading, without disturbances. This is why Bezos has everyone read a 6-page document in silence at the start of a meeting. By the time everyone has finished, they are literally on the same page - and can then discuss and take decisions. In an online meeting, it’s also a good idea to share documents your participants can read - even if it means they are reading in silence during the first ten minutes of the meeting. At first it seems odd, but it’s extremely efficient. Where you decide to use slides, ensure they are aimed at keeping or focusing everyone’s attention rather than delivering information.\n5. Facilitate online meetings - before, during, and after.\nA meeting without a facilitator is like an orchestra without a conductor: a lot of talented people making an awful noise. The facilitator may not - and ideally should not - speak for more than half of the time, unless they are also the main presenter in a webinar or webcast. But their role is key. Before the meeting, the facilitator sets the meeting purpose, invites the right people, reminds them, sets up the technology for the meeting, prepares and shares any pre-read documents, and plans the meeting agenda, remembering the first 4 revolutions. During the meeting, the facilitator keeps time – or assigns someone else to be the timekeeper – while ensuring everyone has a chance to contribute, making the agenda flow, and ensuring the meeting objectives are reached. It’s also very important for the facilitator, and any other speakers, to speak clearly and engagingly, so everybody wants to listen and can easily understand. After the meeting, the facilitator should ensure proper meeting minutes or outcomes are shared with participants as well as stakeholders, so that even people who weren’t there will know what happened and what was decided. (This means people won’t feel compelled to attend just to stay in the loop – and fewer participants make for a more productive meeting.)\nThere is much we can improve about virtual meetings, and we have 5 webinars on the subject - our first webinar is live on YouTube - all of which are simply a condensed version of what we have to share in our Virtual Meeting Revolution course.

Here are the top 5 talks of events we participated to, in number of views.\nIn fifth place we have Jean-Gabriel Causse, speaking at TEDx Dunkerque, with nearly 600,000 views. Color me shocked, but his is talk about the power of colors is full of interesting details.\nIn fourth place is Maïa Mazaurette. Her talk about sexuality, at TEDx Tours 2019, is getting close to 800,000 views, and we have no doubt that she will be over 1 million soon.\nPanayotis Pascot, with more than 800,000 views, is number 3 with his talk at TEDx McGill. He talks about dreaming, daring and never giving up.\nIn second place is Yann Arthus-Bertrand, talking about his movie Home and his exhibit 7 billion others (which was still called 6 billion others in 2009, how things change…)\nAnd in first place, with more than 1 million views, is Karim Noui’s video. In his talk at TEDx Tours, he explains how little we know about our universe.\nNumber of views is not the ultimate measure of the quality of a talk; some of the talks I personally liked a lot only a couple hundred views. We should also keep in mind that the audience of YouTube is younger than average, and that topics that appeal to young people have a higher chance to become popular.\nFinally, I finish with a video that maybe doesn’t have as many views as the others, but which I find really great; it was at TEDx IÉSEG Lille several years ago, and Augustin Petit demonstrates how a good magician can play with our attention.

How do we do it at Ideas on Stage?\nFrom day one, Ideas on Stage was created as a digital company. In fact, for many years, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a physical office. Even today, we strongly encourage our employees to work remotely and limit their travel to what\u0026rsquo;s necessary. We can deliver 90% of our services at distance to our clients, whether it\u0026rsquo;s the creation of a presentation, coaching or training. I think that what we learned in ten years of remote work may be useful to other companies who are not used to this type of organization, and this is what I\u0026rsquo;d like to share in this article.\nThe key success factor: autonomous employees Let me say this immediately: remote work does not suit everyone. My personal observation is that successful remote employees all share a common quality: autonomy. Successful remote employees are autonomous, self-starters. They are the diamonds of a remote work environment.\nProcrastinators, people who need a daily kick in the butt to get things done, will struggle in a result-oriented work environment, but can still succeed with active supervision. Employees who always find excuses for everything, try to avoid responsibilities and rely on others to get their own work done are the least efficient when working remotely. But honestly, they were never that efficient.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about the result, not the number of hours Measuring the performance of remote employees based on number of hours worked is only possible using permanent surveillance, à la Big Brother. There are even tools that check how often the employee moves his mouse and types on his keyboard! I call that measure of performance HSOYA: Hours Sitting On Your Ass. A successful remote work environment measures mainly one thing: work done, in quantity and quality.\nClear deliverables A result oriented work environment brings us to the next logical success factor: clear deliverables for each team member. Each team member knows the deliverables he is responsible for, its boundaries and the deadline. Large deliverables should be broken down into smaller ones that never take longer than a couple of days to complete.\nAn adaptable organisation As a CEO of a company or the head of a department with remote workers, keeping a traditional, top-down organization is the surest way to spend ten hours a day doing video calls. In a remote work environment, the bottlenecks of a top-down, highly hierarchical environment becomes even more apparent: it just holds everything back.\nInstead, I think that a high level of adaptability in the organization works best. Instead of being stuck in a rigid organization chart, individuals freely assemble themselves into teams and task forces based on their skills and availability to work on the deliverables.\nAn unlock mechanism Autonomy is good, but it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to handle. Sometimes people can get lost or are unable to use their autonomy wisely. Conflicts can arise between people and project needs. In a decentralized system, work will not always be distributed evenly and fairly between team members. If not taken into account, it can give a feeling of unfair treatment to employees, foster resentment and bring projects to a halt. This is why it\u0026rsquo;s important to have procedures in place to raise and unlock these stress points quickly.\nTools Dropbox, Office 365, Email, Slack and Zoom are the core tools that we use to enable our decentralized work. Some of us also use Youcanbookme and Zapier. These tools are simple, but their use is not \u0026ldquo;obvious\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s important to get people to use them properly, and have someone in charge of the administration of each tool.\nRegular events Even if we work well remotely, having team events from time to time is important. We do two remote calls per week, one focused on sales, one focused on projects. We also have regular face to face meeting in our offices. Once a month, we meet to work on the development of the company, and once every quarter we have a bigger two-day event.\nConclusion: it\u0026rsquo;s easier than you think Adopting a remote work environment is easier than you think. Nowadays nearly all companies have digital tools. The biggest obstacle is psychological: moving from a top-down, rigid and high control organization to a decentralized, adaptable and results based organization requires a shift in mindset and practice. But if people are forced to stay home, moving to an efficient remote work organization will become a matter of survival for many companies and an opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/03/03/2020-03-03-how-we-deliver-our-services-remotely/","summary":"","tags":["Remote Work","Remote"],"title":"How we deliver our services remotely"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"A lot of people think that organizing an event is within everyone’s reach. But is it really true? If you want to organize one for your company, a lot is at stake, including brand reputation as well as the satisfaction of your customers or guests. If you don’t want to take any chances and make a positive impression, it’s important to set up a team dedicated to your project.\nIf you are the organizer in the hot seat, you are likely asking yourself many questions. Should I call a specialist or do the project internally? How do I make sure not to forget anything important? How do I manage the stress and additional work load? And the list goes on. To help you sort through the questions and challenges of planning a successful event, I interviewed Marine, our experienced and extremely efficient event manager, about the advantages of hiring an event coordinator.\nQ: Marine, why would someone hire an Event Manager? A: Hi Pierre! If the entire weight of the event rests on your shoulders, you will eventually reach the point of burnout. So, to minimize the physical and mental stress associated with leading an event, it is important to streamline roles and responsibilities and get comfortable with delegating most tasks across the team. That said, internal delegation only goes so far. Sometimes you need to bring in experience to ensure success.\nQ: Tell us more, which tasks could be offload**ed to an external event organizer? A: Well, you can start with your least favorite tasks! (laughs) Seriously, you are already juggling your everyday work demands. If someone else takes care of your least favorite tasks, you will be more able to focus on the big picture. Clients love that.\nQ: What about the coordination with other suppliers? A: Throughout the process, an event coordinator can be your trusted link with suppliers: no more calls from the caterer about how many napkins to provide; no more infinite to-do lists filling your day with secondary details. They can keep you updated on the progress of your event step-by-step and answer any questions you have along the way.\nQ: There are so many decisions to make when organizing an event. Can the coordinator help there? A: Of course. If you have never organized an event before, you may be feeling overwhelmed about where to start or how to make wise choices. A professional coordinator will have done this dozens of times before. I have worked on events across a wide variety of industries and can therefore guide clients through any and all decisions they need to make with more confidence than someone who is doing this as a one-off. We are used to multitasking and handling the spectrum of event challenges that inevitably arise.\nQ: Teams know their organizational culture best. So how can someone external help clients make an event memorable? A: It’s true external coordinators must partner with internal stakeholders to make an event meaningful. That said, our methodology of highlighting key messages, unifying them under a common theme and offering fresh ideas with an outside perspective has shown time and again to make a remarkable difference. We select and organize creative activities that infuse events with fun and memorable moments. After all, you want your team to remember an amazing event for what it meant to them and not just for the quality of the champagne.\nQ: Organizing an event can be stressful. How do you help our clients keep calm? A: Even if you have the time and experience, there is no denying that event management can be stressful. The risk, responsibilities, negotiations, and myriad other things to handle flood in. Having us by your side guarantees a lighter load and sweeter, smoother experience overall. We will ensure you don’t overextend yourself or your team. Creating an amazing event can be a wonderful experience, and it is our pride and pleasure to be sure you enjoy the process.\nThank you very much Marine for taking the time to share your perspective on how you have supported our events clients.\nIf you want to learn more about how to create an amazing event, here are our 12 tips.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/02/25/2020-02-25-why-should-i-hire-an-external-event-coordinator-an-experienced-event-manager-s-point-of-view/","summary":"","tags":["Events","Business Event","Project Management","Business"],"title":"Why should I hire an external event coordinator?

Looking at my script, I realized that many sentences could be simplified, some details omitted, and the structure streamlined.\nAfter several dry runs and rewrites, we finally managed to get the video down to 3 minutes. But this once again demonstrated that creating a good short video takes a lot more effort than creating a long one.\nThis is true for almost every TED, TEDx or Keynote presentation. It’s very unusual to have to lengthen a speech. Most of the time, we have to cut it down to get to the core of the message and to avoid exceeding the maximum time allowed. Rambling is cheap, conciseness precious.\nThe next time you prepare a presentation, ask yourself: when was the last time your audience wished it was longer? What can I remove? What can I simplify? Instead of adding one more detail, remove what is not indispensable. Instead of trying to cram one more graph in the last blank square centimeter, remove everything that is not needed. This will greatly improve your presentation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/02/04/2020-02-04-if-you-want-to-be-brief-and-to-the-point-prepare/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"If you want to be brief and to the point, prepare"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Is there a perfect recipe for a successful presentation? No. Partly it depends on the audience and the context: a boardroom presentation shouldn’t look like a TED talk, even if the subject is the same. And different presentations at the same event – a conference, a demo day, an Executive Committee meeting – should also look different from each other, because otherwise none of them will stand out.\nSo if there is no magic formula, are there at least some key ingredients we should always include?\nOver the last ten years, I’ve given thousands of speakers countless pieces of advice on how to make their presentations resonate with their audiences. Finally, out of all these great tips and ideas, I’ve boiled it down to three magic ingredients. If you include these in your presentation, you’ll be well on the road to success.\nThese were the subject of my recent TEDx talk at TEDxSaclay. Perhaps you’d like to discover them live by watching this short video – or if not, scroll down to see a summary.\nSo let’s recap these three magic ingredients:\nThe Audience – it’s their presentation, not yours, so personalize your presentation to suit your audience, their needs and their expectations, as well as their context. Bring them into the presentation and make it special for them, and they will listen attentively. The Speaker – even if it’s their presentation, it’s important for you to put something personal into it. If someone else could have delivered the exact same talk with the exact same words, then there’s nothing of you in there, and that matters because when you share, we care. So make it clear why you care, and tell them stories and examples from your experience to illustrate your key messages. Transformation – too many presentations aim only to inform their audience, and that fails because people forget most of what they hear very quickly. Presentations are best for transforming audiences: changing something in what they believe, feel and do. Always build your presentation around your transformational objectives. In the second part of this TEDx talk, I showed the Ideas on Stage Audience Transformation Roadmap™, our simple but extremely powerful tool for setting these transformational objectives and brainstorming what to say, show and do to achieve them. This has been used thousands of times already in all kinds of situations, and not only for great presentations: also for event planning, proposal writing, preparing job interviews or even writing tough emails or press releases.\nThe Audience Transformation Roadmap works in any situation where you need to change what people believe, feel and/or do. Even better, we’ve shared it as part of our commitment to improving communication, using a Creative Commons license so you can use it without charge (as long as you don’t try to sell it as your own - simple conditions available here).\nIf you’d like to learn more about using the Audience Transformation Roadmap, or the three magic ingredients, or anything else about presentations; or if you’d like help to facilitate a brainstorming session; or if you’d like to invite me to speak to your teams about better business communication (in English or French), simply contact us using the form below.\nAnd if you liked this talk, please share it with your colleagues.

Yes, that one based upon a mash-up of some of your favorite TED speakers whom you are certain you’ll never be as good as. Well, forget it!\nWelcome to the Post-TED style of authenticity centered presentation.\nIn my last article, Wash that TED right out of your head: New Post-TED presentation, we explored some of the foundational reasons which many are experiencing, and what I call, “TED-like style Fatigue”. Please see that first, as it was the second in a series of three articles exploring this subject. However, if you already think you know what I mean by TED-like style fatigue, then by all means read on.\nSo, we have established that we are growing rather weary of the formulaic and “highly oratorial,” perfectly polished, and perfectly predictable TED-like style that we see time and time again. Fine. What comes after then?\nWhat follows as alluded to above are presentation and communication efforts that are more fully grounded in the authenticity of the speaker and front compassion for the audience over competition for likes and shares; while empathetically engaging with the audience by providing content in a more meaningful and fulfilling manner. More meaningful and fulfilling because with empathy as a brick in the backbone construction of your communication, you have put yourself in their shoes and taken off your boots of competition worn to crush the opponent and thereby, crush your communication as well.\nThere is no winning in a Post TED-like style world of presentations, because when you employ the structural architecture principles of Authenticity, Compassion, and Empathy as the new triumvirate for the 21st century, there will be no losers either.\nIn the old world of TED-like style presentations, the targeted focus message for the presentation was explaining and showing the “why” behind the subject matter. While explanation of the “why” is essential in all presentations, too many presenters put a singular focus not on the “why”, but on the “why is my presentation better than others,” and that does not work anymore in a world moving increasingly in a non-rivalrous direction. Thus exclusively “why” focused presentations can only be effective in a time where the cultural sense of cohesion is based upon exclusion and rarity. A society that is knitted together by the strategy of keeping difference out. Thus, the “why” or foundational motivation, your company, product, project, or idea is better than anyone else’s only works well in a world used to being separated into classes of winners and losers.\nThankfully, many have begun to see the vapidity of this world view; and are increasingly rejecting presentations and communication efforts forged from the rusted constructive remains of this broken technology.\nIt is no wonder that many are seeking a new way to present which embodies and exemplifies the new times we are living into.\nWhat I am suggestion for the Post TED-like times is that we flip the focus and open a perspective which was barely available for us before. The perspectival pivot is from “why” to “how.” In employing Authenticity, Compassion, and Empathy as the ontological ground for communication, the process will effectively be opened towards emergence and connection. A presentation created and delivered using the “how” triumvirate will clear a path towards discovering new and perhaps unexpected outcomes. While not necessarily rigidly predictable, this approach will nonetheless lead towards something new and collectively experienced to emerge. What the speaker and audience authentically experience and produce together is something that will likely be remembered and acted upon; the ultimate end goals for any successful presentation.\nSo how do we proceed?\nWe proceed by employing our new triumvirate for the 21st century Post TED-like style presentations:\nAuthenticity. The bad news is that you will never become the mash-up of your favorite presenters; the good news, however, is that you can only be you. And by being fully and uniquely you, you are offering your audience something that no other speaker can. A gift which audience after audience comes in the hope of finding but so rarely do, as speaker after speaker disappoint us by using formulaic devices and never fully show up. No matter how skillfully acted and played on “stage,” be it an actual stage in a theater, across the space of a board room, or face to face with another person; without communicating from your authentic core, your audience will be sorely disappointed and will be left unsatisfied by the effort. Thus, audiences are very unlikely to either remember it, or act upon your message. Authenticity takes courage and trust, and with some support can very readily be developed.\nCompassion. Compassion means that you earnestly seek to lessen the suffering of another. And this is way overdue as far too many audiences have been pummeled into somnambulistic submission by far too many win-seeking speakers using their “whys” as ramming rods for attention dominance. Of course, this never works out well for too long. Our new Post TED-like style calls for careful compassionate consideration of each and every one of our audiences, no matter how large or small the number. From individuals to stadiums, compassion must come first. Give your ego the day off and take the time to work out their needs first, not yours. Speak authentically to that and your will always be very warmly welcomed and likewise your message will be warmly received and retained.\nEmpathy. Whereas compassion refers to your desire to relieve suffering; empathy is the ability to feel for the other. As we say, to put yourself in the other’s shoes and both see and feel their worldview. Once you compassionately know their needs, then you feel through them and construct your communication in a respectful manner which corresponds to their intellectual and emotional requirements which they carry into this communicational context. For you as a speaker, it is more advantageous to be fully felt than to be loudly and coldly heard. Shouting your “why” regardless of the internal state of your audience, will only lead to mutual disappointment in the end.\nThus, we now have it.\nThe “how” for the Post TED-like style for 21st century presenting and communicating. By always being your authentic self, compassionately looking to help your audience, and empathetically delivering your message, you are clearing the way for highly meaningful and emergent communication to occur!\nJust in time for when we need it most.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2020/01/07/2020-01-07-life-after-ted-how-to-show-up-in-the-post-ted-world/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"Life after TED: How to show up in the Post-TED world"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"The lectern is a staple of traditional speeches.

Yes, the lectern is really that formal, and in 99% of the cases, that\u0026rsquo;s not a good thing.\nOur advice is simple: if you\u0026rsquo;re not a politician, avoid the lectern. Even the CEOs of the biggest companies today do without it. And even for politicians, the lectern can be challenged, as Obama proved when he did some of his best speeches standing right in front of the crowd. Instead, ask for a microphone (preferrably a TED-style headset), get closer to the audience and start a conversation.\nThe only exception is when speaking in countries where respect of tradition is extremely important.

We are not going to discuss the full results here, but what is clear is that the top 3 hasn’t changed much in many years. You could probably guess them just by asking yourself “what do I hate about PowerPoint presentations?” The top three problems are:\nThe speaker reads the slides to us\nThe text is too small\nUse of full sentences\nNumber one is a no. This is one of the first things we teach to people using “slideuments”: never read your presentation. A presentation is not a prompter that you read at the same time as your audience. This is an extremely ineffective method of communication. It will bore your audience so much they will fall asleep or start crying.\nNumber two is obvious, or rather should be obvious: text that is so small nobody can read it is useless, and should be avoided.\nNumber three is a bit weird. Why would people be annoyed by full sentences? Using short and simple sentences is fine. We think that the correct formulation for that problem should be “use of sentences that are too long or too complicated.”\nText overload\nNot having a clear purpose\nNot having a clear flow of ideas.\nAll common problems that we still see in most companies. Number 4, text overload, is a sign that the presenter doesn’t know the difference between a slideument (a written document being used as a presentation in front of an audience) and an actual presentation (a slideshow showing only what reinforces or clarifies the message). Not having a clear purpose, point number 5, is usually a sign of poor preparation, and a sign of focusing on what is in the presenter’s mind instead of what should be communicated to the audience. Number 6, not having a clear flow of ideas, is directly connected to number 5 and is another symptom of the same root causes.\nWe have simple advice to avoid these 6 problems:\nDon’t read your slides. Instead, learn the storyline and talk naturally to your audience. Use a visual presentation, showing only what is needed to clarify or reinforce your message. Never use slideuments, written documents disguised as PowerPoint presentations, on screen in front of an audience. Make sure that all text is at least 16 pt or better 24 pt. Actual size may vary depending on the room setting. The bigger the room, the bigger the text needs to be. When creating your slides, take a step back from your computer screen and check that you can read everything from a distance. Use only a few words or very simple sentences. Sentences that are more than one or two lines long should usually be avoided. Use the Audience Transformation Roadmap to structure and prepare the content of your presentation.

If poor musical tastes offend you, don’t read this.\nLast week, I was searching for an old song on YouTube, when suddenly I noticed a video from Joan Baez. I realized that, despite priding myself on my knowledge of 60s music, I never actually listened to one of her songs. So I clicked and listened to it. It was called Diamonds and Rust.\nThe first thing that struck me was that Joan Baez has a voice that is nearly too perfect, especially compared to Bob Dylan\u0026rsquo;s, her contemporary and, for a brief time, lover. The chord progression is fairly standard. The lyrics are OK, but not amazing. They tell a story of love and betrayal, an extremely common theme.\nWhat makes this song special is not the chords or the lyrics. It\u0026rsquo;s the story behind the story. This song doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell just a story of love and betrayal. It tells Joan\u0026rsquo;s own love and betrayal story with Bob Dylan. This is what gives this song so much resonance, so much meaning: the moment you realize that Joan is laying her wounds bare to the listener, the whole act takes another emotional dimension.\nThis emotional depth is what makes truly great stories. And to achieve it, you have to accept being fully vulnerable on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/12/03/2019-12-03-the-story-behind-the-story/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"The story behind the story"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Some leaders are afraid to let other people know that they took public speaking coaching. I want to explain why it’s a mistake, and why the best leaders are proud of being coached.\nThe Consulting Partner who hired me back in 1996, for a company that was then called Andersen Consulting, was an extremely charismatic person and an excellent orator. One advice he gave openly to his peers, and to us young consultants, was to get professional public speaking coaching to become better orators. He was proud to say that he took coaching sessions.\nI could witness the huge difference between his oratory skills and the skill of another partner during two “techno meetings” where all European technology consultants met for two days. The first year, the event took place in Disneyland Paris. The master of ceremony was the head of the French Technology practice, but he struggled to become alive on stage. He was so fixated on the idea that because he was a partner he didn’t need coaching (or rather, didn’t dare to tell others that he needed coaching) that he failed to show the necessary oratory skills to turn a multimillion event into a great success. His stress and awkwardness on stage were so obvious that it made everyone feel uneasy. All because he thought that as a partner he shouldn’t need coaching.\nThe next year, the Techno meeting took place in Brussels, and the partner who hired me was the master of ceremony. Despite being a good orator, or maybe, because he was a good orator, he didn’t come on stage unprepared. He took public speaking coaching sessions to make sure he would be 100% ready. What a difference it made. Everyone was captivated, laughed, listened and remembered the stage sessions as a highlight of the event. Despite being in a more modest place than Disneyland, the event was a great success (and the party music was better too!)\nThat partner was not perfect. He had his flaws, as we all have. But I will always remember that as a leader, being coached should be natural. All top leaders and politicians admit freely that coaching is very important. They are secure about themselves and see being coached as another way to improve their skills. And in the end, that approach makes them even better leaders.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/26/2019-11-26-being-coached-is-the-mark-of-true-leaders/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Coaching"],"title":"Being coached is the mark of true leaders"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"What happens when two parties position themselves in a similar manner on the same topic? Simple: the one which is the most credible wins. By “most credible,” I mean “the one that incarnates the rhetoric with the most authenticity.”\nThere is a mistake that has been made by many traditional parties. Some traditional parties saw new parties start to gain popularity by advocating extremist views. So they started to adopt a slightly watered down version of these views to attract voters. But they were terribly wrong. By doing so, they got doubly punished: they destroyed part of their credibility by betraying their historical values, and also managed to give a broader acceptance to these extremist views, making them more mainstream and putting extremist ideas in the spotlight. The exact opposite of what they intended to do.\nTraditional parties are never going to win the battle of extremism. People who are already convinced by these extremist views are going to vote for the extremist parties; and even more now in the social media age as their confirmation biases are continually affirmed. People who hesitate, the extremely important floating voters, are swayed towards extremist parties, because their views are made more acceptable by being embraced by the traditional parties.\nThere is only one way to win against extremism. It’s to fight it without compromise and never let it become acceptable. Yes, there are problems that must be solved. Yes, our world is imperfect. Yes, the way some people take advantage of the system is unacceptable. But we must never let racism, sexism or other movements based on the assumption that some humans are superiors to others become acceptable at any level of our societies. And we must speak out authentically against all extremism.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/19/2019-11-19-what-happens-when-two-political-parties-use-the-same-rhetoric/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"What happens when two political parties use the same rhetoric?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You’ve probably already seen those presenters who climb on stage and rush into their presentation, apparently oblivious to the fact that they have an audience in front of them.

I’ve just given the most, I mean most boring presentation of my life and I need to learn how to give a more interesting and captivating presentation.\nMichael: So what happened?\nRose: I just gave the most boring presentation of my life.\nMichael: How? What did people say?\nRose: Something about my voice. And they don’t care what I had to say.\nMichael: Sounds to me like it’s monotony, right?\nRose: Yeah that sounds about right.\nMichael: So they said you sounded monotonous. That is a problem with presenting for sure. But I do have a solution.\nRose: What’s that?\nMichael: It’s called the Four Tempos. Now, the four tempos are based on work by Yat Malmgrem who created movement psychology when he worked with dancers and actors. What I’ve done is I’ve taken it and made it more simple and useful for speakers. Get a pen and try it. Write it down.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: So, imagine an axis. First axis is the intention: light and strong. Second axis is vowels: short vowels, long vowels. Let’s hit the first tempo. The first tempo is called bright.\nRose: Bright.\nMichael: Bright is short vowels and light intention. Okay? So it’s like a dabbing rhythm: dab-dab-dab. And you link it with the objective of humoring the audience, welcoming them. You know, just kind of getting a light and friendly tone going when you speak. Give it a try.\nRose: Welcome, today I have great news.\nMichael: That’s great, you see. Excellent. Let’s move on to the second tempo. The second tempo is called human. That’s light intention and long vowels. So we link that with the objective of reassuring an audience, to calm them, to seduce them even. Give it a try.\nRose: Our technology is as relevant as ever.\nMichael: Excellent! So the third tempo is called bold. Bold is strong intention and short vowels. So the motivation here is to get their attention, wake them up, make them motivated with this punchy kind of rhythm. All right? Pam, pam, pam! Give it a try.\nRose: With three million new users we are ready to take new risks!\nMichael: That’s it! Excellent! Great. And now onto the last tempo, which is called captivating. Captivating is strong intention and long vowels. Right? So this is linked with objectives such as to underscore, to really spell something out or perhaps even to threaten your audience, or to warn them. Kind of like a pushing tempo. Give it a try.\nRose: Okay. So, let’s seize the future together.\nMichael: Yeah, together! Excellent, very good. So that’s it. Bright, human, bold, captivating. And you can mix up your vocal rhythms and tempos and wake the audience up and get them more interested in what you’re saying.\nRose: That’s fantastic. Thank you so much Michael. I’m really glad I came here. So let’s recap.\nKEY TAKE AWAYS\nEngage your listeners with different tempos. Make your messages more memorable with phrasing. Link your vocal rhythm to your objective.

Using a few of these clichés is fine, because they are often the clearest way to illustrate the idea of the slide; it’s nice to be creative, but clarity of the message comes first.\nBut some presentations seem to overflow with these clichés, using them on every slide. So I asked myself the question: why are some presentations nearly cliché-free, while other presentations are full of them? This question is not as trivial as it may seem. In fact, after some thinking and reviewing the presentations that used a lot of clichés, I realized why: it’s because their narrative is cliché. They are loaded with abstract business concepts such as engagement, empowerment, synergies, but are empty of concrete elements. These presentations promise a lot, but have nothing concrete to show for it.\nSo when a presentation requires the use of too many clichés, the right thing to ask ourselves is: how could I make the content more concrete? Instead of the cheesy handshake to illustrate collaboration, show a picture of your employees having fun during a team-building activity. Instead of the light bulb to represent innovation, show the latest ideas from your teams. Instead of the generic upward graph, show real results.\nIn a company where none of these concrete elements can be found, I would seriously ask myself why.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/11/05/2019-11-05-cliche-slides/","summary":"","tags":["Slides","PowerPoint","Visuals"],"title":"Cliché slides"},{"author":"Joe Ross","contents":"The days of the expert or reliable narrator are over. We have entered the “Disinformation Age” where fake news, conspiracy stories, and meme warfare rule.\nOne of the most prominent casualties, at least from a presentation perspective, is the TED-like style, top down, subject matter expert: the teacher or preacher schooling their passively sitting and listening students.\nWe see trust move from the command and control leadership style and morph into something vastly flatter, decentralized/distributed, and perhaps even autonomously self-organizing.\nIn our new “Disinformation Age,” information distribution has become democratized. Anyone with an internet access can create and upload written, audio, or visual content with a click of a button. The problem though is that not all content is equal. Anyone with a YouTube account and a smart phone can suddenly appear as a subject matter expert on just about any topic in ten minutes or less in lieu of the ten years on average of postgraduate work that real experts put in. I don’t know about you, but when I am sick, or my kids come down with something, I rely on our medical professionals who have logged the ten plus years of study combined with twenty plus years of practice, over a self-made expert with a microphone telling me that vaccines are part of a global plot to control citizens, or my 40-degree fever is just a physical manifestation of what’s in my head. I don’t want to draw a hard line here, as there may be some truth that mental stress plays a role in illness, but I believe you see my point.\nWe have now entered a time of post-experts and post-trusted informers. The days of the trusted TV news anchor broadcasting are long behind us; we find ourselves awash in a war of contradicting narratives vying for the support of the masses as justification of their validity.\nSo, are TED-style talks still the best way to communicate?\nCan this be one of the root reasons why audience taste has been declining for these “experts” tell all events? It is very difficult to have exact statistics, but clearly, and especially for the younger generation, the passion for hearing the word coming down from on high is waning. Just as in education, the trend towards a different approach of knowledge sharing is on the rise; however that is not my subject as we have all been enriched and enlightened by earnest TED and TEDx speakers over the years.\nHowever, we must ask now, what is coming after, what was learned and what needs to transform?\nFirst, why we are growing tired of the TED-like style; what is advancing us towards the end of our decade old love affair? Let me suggest some things that I identified in concert with my colleague at Ideas on Stage, Michael Rickwood, of which we have grown weary.\nThere is the old saying, familiarity breeds contempt, perhaps this applies here. There are just too many TED-like events happening just about every week in every city; too much of something, no matter how good, becomes tiring. We are becoming to see the fatigue of familiarity creep in.\nAnd why do we feel familiarity? I mean if every talk has a different topic, why should we become familiar? I’d suggest that it is not the topic’s fault; rather it is the now formulaic and repetitive manner by which speakers prepare and deliver their talks. They seem to be more focused on presenting like all the presenters they have watched before, and never really stop a moment to consider their audience and what those buying tickets might be expecting.\nWhat do I mean by formulaic? Well, I’d suspect that if you watched a fair number of presentations, you could probably tell me! In fact, there are sadly funny talks where presenters mock the now traditional TED-like style of presenting, i.e. the surprise twists, the moment of the now predictable sudden twist in the plot, and above all the “happy ending” emotion-laden finish carefully crafted to gain applause.\nAnd of course, there are the occasional opportunists who use these events to hijack the stage for self-promoting purposes.\nThis style of presenting—please see an earlier article that Michael and I posted on Pathos, Ethos, Logos—contributes to an imbalance towards pathos is our general presentation style. Now we have both business leaders and politicians playing to the emotions with often little regard for either the veracity, i.e. truth, facts of the situation; and worse, with little regard for the ethos, the ethical moral side of the case.\nNo wonder we are in the state we are.\nWe have lost the balance in the storytelling formula. As Ideas on Stage cofounder Pierre Morsa puts it, “The formula is like for Hollywood movies. It is necessary: movies that miss one ingredient of the formula are often failures. You can omit some elements, but you have to understand the impact of doing so. And ultimately, although all Hollywood movies use the same formula, some are great and some suck.”\nSo, what do we do?\nWe, at Ideas on Stage are coaching our speakers towards what we have come to call, the “Post-Ted” style of presenting.\nWe will explore and define this in a forthcoming article, but not to leave you hanging; as the classic TED-like style talk might use to build up suspense and keep you listening … well, maybe I am here, but that is too meta for this article.\nWhat we are leading is the “Post-Ted” presentation approach, one that fronts an ethical and balanced presentation by employing honest communication that has these three pillars: authenticity, compassion, and empathy.\nThese may very well be the new triumvirate for the 21st century and quite possibly could rekindle our passion for presentation.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/10/29/2019-10-29-wash-that-ted-right-out-of-your-head-avoiding-bad-ted-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking"],"title":"Wash that Ted right out of your head: new post-Ted presentation"},{"author":"Camille Spokojny","contents":"A funny thing happened when I was describing my “dream job” to a friend. I imagined a company whose mission would be to help people become great presenters, and had a culture that was both supporting and nurturing while remaining professional and attentive to clients’ needs. My friend said: “I know that company!”\nA few weeks later after a relaxing summer vacation between positions, I found myself in the company of all my new colleagues, some whom I met for the very first time, at our annual Fall team meeting. We spent the next few days together working night and day on exactly what my role would be and how we can better serve our partners and clients.\nSo what’s my role? In four words: keep my colleagues busy! Their role is to deliver our top-class presentation creation, training, speaker coaching and event services; my role is to make sure they have plenty to do.\nTo fulfill this role, I have three main objectives:\nKeep our clients delighted Help our partners to sell our services to their clients Build our brand and business internationally First, I’ll be linking up with many of our clients to establish a relationship and become a key point of contact for them, matching their needs to our solutions. This also involves linking back with them after each mission to check how things went and how we can delight them even more in the future.\nSecond, I’ll be the main point of contact for our various partners who offer our services to their clients, giving them all the support (and encouragement) they need to bring us in regularly to deliver more value to their clients.\nThird, I’ll be working on various initiatives to build the Ideas on Stage brand and business in all our countries and beyond, acting as the main link between all our locations, and looking for opportunities to help more presenters in more places.\nSucceeding in all three of these objectives will certainly keep my colleagues busy, and will mean we continue to grow quickly as the leading international presentation specialist. And that means we can help more speakers to shine on stage, more leaders to inspire their people, and more event organizers to design and produce the kind of business events we’d all love to attend.\nIs this my “dream job?” It certainly sounds like it. I’m already feeling very welcome in this fantastic team, I’m passionate about my mission, and I look forward to meeting our clients and partners, so together we can make that dream a reality.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/10/15/2019-10-15-meet-camille-your-new-contact/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Business"],"title":"Meet Camille, your new contact"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"It’s your turn to present.

They can be your employees, your clients, your products, your revenue. They can even be your competitors. Now, what about the setting?\nRose: That\u0026rsquo;s your business context. How are the numbers doing? What\u0026rsquo;s happening in your industry?

We were losing money. So we created a new product which allowed us to raise sales by 10 percent and we hit our goal of 1 billion in revenue.\nPierre: Great story.\nRose: So now we know how to apply these five ingredients to business. Pierre, can we apply everything in traditional storytelling to business story?\nPierre: There is one key difference. In business storytelling you can tell anecdotes, you can tell metaphors, but the key messages should always be based on facts. This is something which is very important and that we will cover in another episode.\nRose: Excellent. So let\u0026rsquo;s recap.\nKey Take Aways Use all five ingredients to tell a business story.

Moving around aimlessly is not. It’s what we call derivative actions, things that we do unconsciously that betray our stress, lack of confidence or lack of preparation. Luckily, it’s very easy to stop parasitic movements, but the solution sounds counterintuitive: use eye contact to \u0026ldquo;anchor\u0026rdquo; yourself on the ground.\nYes, that’s right. Making eye contact with your audience will stabilise your attention and will prevent your feet from moving you around the stage.\nThe trick is to always look at someone in the eye when you talk, alternating between people in various locations in the audience. Make sure you take the time to deliver at least one full sentence before shifting your gaze to someone else. And really look at the person, not just in their general direction. The effect is instantaneous: when you look at someone specific, your brain tells your body to ground and stop moving around.\nIf you’re still not convinced, try to force yourself to move after you have established strong eye contact with someone.

Action\nSurely great music, a uniting theme, an excellent MC, or an inspirational speaker can make a difference, but with these four basic ingredients we believe you can make magic out of any topic whether it be a medical conference or TEDx event.\nAs the title states, an amazing event is an active one.

The event’s purpose is what points to the type of meaningful action you might incorporate. Here are a 12 specific ideas for how you can incorporate the 3 overarching takeaways in our corresponding video podcast episode on Amazing Events.\nTip 1: Only use presentations when necessary Of course there are times when a classic keynote is just the ticket to open or close a conference. Just bear in mind that presentations are not the best way for your team to learn information. Here are a few ways you can inspire and engage your audience both with and beyond presentations:\n1 - Be Lean: when you speak be sure to reset audience attention every 10 minutes, according to mind expert John Medina, author of Brain Rules. You can do this in many ways such as by asking a question or sharing a relevant emotionally compelling anecdote. The less we tell people, the more they remember. So keep your presentation compelling and clear with 1-3 key messages tops.\n2 - Panels: gather a few key opinion leaders whether internal or external, aim for diversity, and add a skilled moderator to create a dynamic and energized discussion.\n3 - Q\u0026amp;A: give your audience a chance to ask their burning questions and aim to be honest, clear and direct in your responses. This can be especially helpful around the rollout of a new program or initiative, or to rebuild trust around a project or leader.\n4 - Group activities: give your team a chance to work in smaller groups to discuss a key question or topic with enough instruction that they are clear how to spend their time and what their objective is and enough freedom to really explore and come to new insight. Then have a spokesperson share a quick update with the larger group.\nTip 2: Do Something! This doesn’t mean people should never sit down during an event or be artifically sporty, nor should you resort to: ‘let’s just throw in an escape game and call it a day’. What we are suggesting is to tap the deeper potential of your team by calling in their whole selves during your event. We are human beings, not laptops. We are meant to move and our brains impressively better when we do. Research shows that activity, creativity and collaboration improve learning and memory retention. Here are few ideas to get the ball rolling on how to pack some action in your event:\n5 - Workshops: when participants get their hands dirty trying to solve a problem related to the purpose of your event, even briefly, they wake up and new neurons fire. Participants become engaged and invested in finding a way forward and more open to solutions.\n6 - Pitch it: instead of long-winded presentations, try a timed 5-10minute pitch and even more fun if you have a few which can playfully compete on fun criteria like most imaginative.\n7 - Stand-up brainstorms: before hearing a presentation why not ask your team to break out into small groups around a paper board, set a timer and brainstorm on a question or issue related to the event topic. After that they’ll be many times more receptive to hearing what you wanted to share with them because they had the opportunity to reflect first about the need.\n8 - Play: have participants improvise a skit, record a video, or write a song in alignment with the purpose of the event. Thinking in new ways and sharing it unleashes new synergy and trust in teams.\nTip 3: Make it memorable with the unexpected We have seen traditional companies host IT conferences and Pharmaceutical teams present new research in refreshing ways. This makes all the difference. If you know everyone loves the champagne hour then keep that in and iterate on the type of speaker or the flow of the event. Here are a few ways you might spice things up…\n9 - Theme: Giving your event a theme is a great way to unite many messages and new information under a meaningful umbrella. We worked on an event called SHIFT, which as you may have guessed was all about “shifting” culture to be more efficient, connected, customer focused and fun. They used activities like test-driving a Tesla and having a formula 1 race simulator available during the breaks. (You can read about the event here.)\n10 - Team building: we also worked on a memorable event that included a team-building treasure hunt in small groups all around Athens, where the conference was held. Meaningful connections occur in moments least expected, like while taking shelter from a downpour in a quaint café over hot Greek coffee.\n11 - Simple delights: have you ever left a welcome note or a little gift related to the event on your guests hotel bed for them to discover upon arrival? Or invited teams to wear their favorite t-shirt? Or all orange? How about hosting a single-song dance party in the middle of a conference? Possible outcome: a little sweat, a burst of laughter and lots of new energy.\n12 - Don’t skip the breaks: we suggest the Disney rule which respects that fact that nature calls us all usually around 1 hour 20 minutes especially after all the coffee we tend to drink to stay alert during long stretches of focus. Then take a longer break at least every 3 hours for a meal or nourishing refreshments. Tip: keep meals and snacks healthy to keep energy and attention high.\nIn sum, events can be wonderful, meaningful and valuable, especially when they’re active. A well planned gathering can pump new energy, motivation and commitment into an organisation. This energy is what we need to turn around a dwindling initiative, improve employee retention and inspire internal innovation. This happens when teams are offered an event developed with purpose and their experience in mind.\nSo remember the four key ingredients to make your next event amazing: purpose, teamwork, creativity and action.

They whine, they threaten, they become petty if they don’t get their way. They don’t hesitate to lie, or even worse, use the emotional card to play the victim, make you look bad and make you submit to their will.\nThese people are easy to recognize, but very difficult to deal with. Just think of the child rolling on the floor screaming. His parents will look bad whatever they do: scold him, do nothing, leave… they have zero good solutions. Other parents know this and usually try to look the other way. And those other parents who intervene usually only make matters worse, because they’re actually looking to shame the child’s parents, which solves nothing and reinforces the child’s power.\nIn front of a spoiled kid rolling on the floor, there seems to be no solution that would not make you look like you’re the bad one. It’s the same for spoiled adults. They derive their power from the fact that whatever you do to try to stop them, you’ll be the one who looks bad.\nSo, what do you do when you’re facing a spoiled adult in a debate or during a Q\u0026amp;A session? You keep calm and dispassionate. If you let your emotions get the better of you, you play by the spoiled adult’s rules and start a contest you cannot win. Instead, refuse to enter into a shouting contest, and re-center the debate or question around the core message, the central pillar. Soon you will be perceived as the responsible adult in charge. The spoiled adult will become a screaming fool.\nWhen possible, there’s an even better solution: take care of the problem before the debate, or at least instill doubt in the mind of the spoiled adult. Show him or her you’re not going to play by their rules. Or let them believe their over-the-top attitude is working, then take them off guard by being the responsible adult on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/17/2019-09-17-the-adult-and-the-spoilt-kid/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate"],"title":"The adult and the spoiled kid"},{"author":"","contents":" Rose: Most people think that a great event is one that fits everything into the agenda. The more the better. Well, we want to share that less is more, especially when it comes to presentations. Today I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have three tips for you on how to create an amazing business event by making it active.\nTip 1: Only use presentations when necessary. Michael: Hey Rose, what are you reading there?\nRose: Presentation Zen.\nMichael: Ah, Presentation Zen!\nMichael: Actually \u0026hellip;. [sped-up long talk about the book]\nRose: So, if you want your employees to remember the information in your event, reconsider all the presentations. The best thing you can give them is a cup of coffee, a book, and silence.\nTip 2: Make an active agenda for an amazing event. Rose: How many times have you been to a conference where you have sat in the same chair listening to what feels like the same presentation, doing nothing, in the same spot for hours and days? It\u0026rsquo;s like sitting on a swing set and not moving. Why? Because we have so much unused potential!\nRose: If you can, get your employees moving, and then you\u0026rsquo;ll see what\u0026rsquo;s really possible. Even better if they can do it together. So, think about workshops, and stand-up work sessions, and what happens if they go outside? You might just start having some fun!\nTip 3: Add in moments of delight, surprise, and breaks. Rose: Beware the impulse to overstuff the agenda for your event. In fact, you need to work in little moments of delight, surprise, and especially breaks. This is the gold in your agenda. This is the time when people start to network and come up with new ideas, and absorb what they\u0026rsquo;ve just learned in the event. So, Michael, what did you think of that last presentation?\nMichael: You know what? I thought it was pretty good.\nKEY TAKE AWAYS Only use presentations when necessary. Make an active agenda for an amazing event. Add in moments of delight, surprise, and breaks. Rose: Thank you for joining The Business Presentation Revolution.

Persuading the human mind.\nToday there is a war on for attention and space, with the human mind as object of the conquest. In 2019, emotions rule the stage and calm reasoned logic seems to have gone out of fashion. Individually and collectively, most of us are getting our information from sound bites, news summaries, and short burst headlines provided by our iPhone feed; while opinions change from one glance at the screen to the next.\nIn this modern landscape, effective presentations and the art of the pitch are more important than ever. To stand out from the noise, in brief 3 minutes or less bursts, is the day’s challenge. Effective, memorable and entertaining have become the new keywords; and the active effort to do this well means positively that we are getting better at communication with each other in business and other arenas. By improving communication skills; things are getting shorter, clearer, more creative and somehow easier to contextualize. Quite a contrast to the once overly long and boring team meetings which have gotten a drastic time-cut in our offices for one!\nOn the flip side, however, the art of the pitch brings some negatives with it. We drown in messages delivered online through hyper-looped highways directly into the windows of our souls, and worse, every presentation ever given now goes on to YouTube and spreads through social media like an unwelcome summer cold.\nIn 2019, we are presented with a new paradigm. As things get flashier and nosier and we continue to focus on the how—continuing to make presentations shorter and zippier and catchier—are we forgetting about the what? And more importantly the why?\nMy experience of coaching TED talks has often led me to mixed feelings about these events. On the one hand, they are a great educational resource and inspirational platform for new leaders to get visibility. On the other they risk being an empty window of self-promotion.\nTo get to the heart of meaningful content, the why, we can look back to the Greeks.\nAnd the motivational compass that asks: What kind of a world do I want to live in anyway?\nIn ancient Greece, the principle of the persuasive argument by Aristotle was based on 3 key pillars: Ethos, Logos, and Pathos. Since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the focus in many industries swung to logos: with fact-based and structure being the focused pillar to build upon. Top down, left brain, siloed and reductionist in approach led to a scientific lab like communication style based upon informative data that could be reproduced easily and widely by using primitive means. Today, in the 21st century, with all our high-tech tools, always on multimedia screens, the shift is undeniably towards pathos: the emotional and creative pillar. This has been very welcome but sometimes communication that is too focused only on pathos leaves us with pretty and passionate presentations yet empty and directionless messaging. Ethos has remained present throughout all eras, particularly in the most inspiring of speeches. Leadership, vision and shared experience lighting the way for future generations.\nA balance of all 3 was the original blueprint some three thousand years ago. But it appears Ethos is under threat in certain political spheres, and this can only trickle down to the wider world of business and education.\nIn 2019 we are on a wire. People are polarized, leaders are struggling. Villains in certain places prevail with pathos taking easy, below the belt shots, selling something that they cannot deliver. The compass is spinning, confused. People are not always constant or rooted like trees, many can shift like tectonic plates with many men and women as elastic as a waistline, gorging on a rubbish pathos laden diet. Sure, it might make you feel good for an instant, but the digestion is horribly unpleasant and ultimately harmful to the health of society writ large.\nHowever, history has shown us that working from an ethical center creates success, unites people and with united people comes stability and prosperity within the very largest groups or the smallest.\nWe have lost our balance. By swinging from overly logos centered communication to overly pathos centered communication; our Ethos, our WHY of being is endangered.\nWe recall a quote dating the French Revolution: “With great power, comes great responsibility” the adage is never truer than today. Whether you’re the leader of a small team in a firm or presiding over a giant corporation, what you say will influence the day, week, month and eventually even the lives of the people that you are addressing.\nEthics are about staying true to message, about meaning, and about vision; it’s about the why. From this ground you can build effective and persuasive communication that is solidly grounded while employing the other arts of Logos and Pathos.\nAs every great leader knows, it’s all about balance.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/09/2019-09-09-the-leadership-triangle/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Leadership","Business"],"title":"The leadership Triangle"},{"author":"Nayab Mohammad","contents":"Recently I had the chance to do an internship with Ideas on Stage, which has been by far one of my best experiences.\nAt first, I didn’t quite know what I had stepped into. It was a totally new place and I walked in full of curiosity.\nYou might know the famous saying “Behind every successful man there is a woman.” Well, within this week I understood that “behind every successful presentation there is Ideas on Stage.” They possess the secret key to turn anyone into an excellent speaker. They don’t work miracles, but they have enough magic to turn awful presentations into brilliant ones.\nFurthermore, I met a team with original personalities. A bunch of creative, cool and awesome people willing to take boredom out of this world. They are like a big family working in an enjoyable atmosphere, and I loved that.\nI always carry a quote in my bag that says “You learn something new every day,” which fits perfectly with the description of this week. Let me tell you more about it.\nMarine Bénard welcomed me on Monday morning, presented the company and kindly accompanied me throughout the week. Also, she handed me The Business Presentation Revolution, which, to make it short, taught me that if you want to SCORE in life you must learn your ABCs. (What does that mean? You’ll need to read the book or follow the course!)\nThe next day was a big dose of inspiration, motivation, and admiration. When I spoke with Phil Waknell, one of the founders of the company, I learned not only about Ideas on Stage’s values, but I also got tips on how to make a business work and what leadership is about. Phil enlightened me when he affirmed “Leadership is the art of being followed.”\nSpeaking of art, my favorite pieces of art are humans. And I believe speaking is a fundamental need for human beings. According to René Descartes, the French philosopher, the use of language as a manifestation of thought and ideas, makes the distinction between humans and animals. Therefore, working on communication is fundamental.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, I asked Vanessa Querville why she likes her job and she told me that it’s all about the impact. When she feels her coaching is moving something forward, helping the other person progress, that is when she gets a real sense of achievement. She faces a challenge to bring out the best speaker we can be.\nWith Frédéric-Pascal Stein, on Thursday afternoon, I understood that the magic of Ideas on Stage is to make us realize what someone in their right mind would do when it comes to presentations and pitches: be clear and simple. Get straight to the point. Do not annoy anybody, including yourself, with pointless details. Be confident and be yourself. A lot of what Ideas on Stage does is to show us obvious things we don’t manage to notice by ourselves.\nOn Friday, I got the opportunity to attend a coaching session with Michael Rickwood and I saw the way he adapted himself according to what his client needed. If the person needed to be reassured or if they only needed advice with some encouragement, Michael did what was most appropriate and did not try to impose a method his client was not looking for.\nOnly a small number of experiences change your perspectives, and this is one of them. I came out of this internship changed, transformed. These people caught 100% of my attention and my brain was fully concentrated and focused the entire time. Sharing their world for some time, and feeling as if I was a part of it, was wonderful.\nPeople often misuse the word outstanding, but Ideas on Stage can be qualified as outstanding because they do things differently. They are different and that is why they stand out from the rest. They deserve great things and something I will never forget from my internship is what Phil told me, it goes something like “be kind and life will be kind to you.”\nNayab Mohammad\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/09/02/2019-09-02-a-student-s-view-of-ideas-on-stage/","summary":"","tags":["News"],"title":"A student’s view of Ideas on Stage"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You may have heard about it, a basic security problem was found in Zoom for Mac, that allowed attackers to turn the camera on remotely. Zoom is an application used to organize videoconferences on the web. It works well and has been widely adopted by corporations and individuals seeking to provide a quality service to employees working remotely or on different sites.\nThe security problem itself was easy to correct, and, at the time of this article, should have been fixed. But there is something else Zoom needs to fix: its crisis communication approach. One thing in particular made users and the security community extremely unhappy: the “others do it too” attitude. It’s exactly when you reprimand your child because he did something wrong, and he answers, “but other kids did it too!” As a parent, it’s only going to make you even more annoyed. Why? Because that shows he doesn’t get the point, and that instead of learning from his mistake, he’s trying to get approval for his incorrect behavior. And this is basically what Zoom’s initial answer was: “We don’t need to fix this problem, and it’s not really a problem because others do it too.”\nThis is what we call the “others too” communication mistake. Using others’ bad behavior to justify yours. Pointing others’ mistakes is fine if you clearly show that you’re going to correct yours. Zoom’s impact would have been completely different if they had said, “We’re going to fix this problem immediately, others have that problem too.” By taking responsibility to correct their mistake first, the rest of the communication takes a whole different meaning. Small difference in wording, huge difference in result.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/16/2019-07-16-others-too-zoom-s-terrible-communication-misstep/","summary":"","tags":["Public Relations","Communication","Crisis Management","Business"],"title":"“Others Too”: Zoom's Terrible Communication Misstep"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"One of the most stressful moments when speaking at an event is actually not during your presentation, but the hours before your presentation. To some speakers, the wait can be so stressful that they completely lose their presence. As mother nature didn\u0026rsquo;t give humans an appropriate instinctive response to face the stress of a presentation, they adopt one of the basic survival techniques for protection: they fight the public, they flee, or they \u0026ldquo;play dead\u0026rdquo;. The longer they wait, the worse the problem becomes.\nMy advice is simple: put these speakers early in the program. You may want to put a seasoned speaker on stage first, but then I recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t let the nervous ones wait for too long. This will greatly reduce the risk of meltdown on stage.\nOf course, there are techniques to cope with stress. There are easy tricks, but when the source of the stress is a lack of self-confidence or self-esteem, that takes time to correct. In some cases, it can be a lifelong battle. If you feel some speakers are not going to manage the stress well, don\u0026rsquo;t make them wait for too long, it will make them feel miserable and they will not enjoy the experience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/09/2019-07-09-put-your-most-nervous-speakers-early-in-the-program/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx","Fear","Events"],"title":"Put your most nervous speakers early in the program"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"You know these presenters who speak for 20 minutes before they finally understand what they are talking about? I had a colleague who was just like that. When I asked him why he couldn’t do a shorter introduction, he said that he felt that all the details he gave in his opening were indispensable to understand the presentation. In other words, he was taking the time to explain the context before talking about his subject. That sounded good in theory. The problem was, because nobody knew what the exact subject was, the elements of context had no meaning and were extremely boring. Making matters worse, because my colleague had not started by identifying the subject, he rambled for much longer than what was really necessary.\nHowever, correcting that problem is fairly easy.\nStart by presenting the “why you are talking today,” the key topics, before anything else. If these topics cannot be understood without context, then they are not clear enough, and should be reformulated.\nOnly once you have done that can you present the context. Avoid the “all you can eat” approach, only give the minimum necessary to understand the key topics.\nThis simple method will make your presentations much more interesting from the beginning, and much easier to follow for your audience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/07/02/2019-07-02-why-you-should-avoid-long-winded-introductions-in-your-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling"],"title":"Start with the subject, not the context"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Should we move on stage when speaking, to avoid looking static? Or should we stay put on our feet, avoiding any unnecessary movements? Strangely, if we ask different coaches, we\u0026rsquo;re likely to get different answers. I remember meeting several coaches who followed classical theatre training at \u0026ldquo;La Comédie Française\u0026rdquo;, and they would recommend that you don\u0026rsquo;t move on stage when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking. I also remember other coaches telling startup pitchers that they looked like dead trees devoid of any energy because they didn\u0026rsquo;t move enough. So who is right?\nAs often, the correct answer is: it depends. It always pains me to see some coaches give \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; advice without taking into account the subtleties of public speaking. A few examples of factors that may influence how much you move:\nThe formality of the setting Your natural style as a speaker The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be filmed If we are in a very formal setting, typically a political meeting, it\u0026rsquo;s best no to move too much. If the setting is more informal, like a pitch contest, looking dynamic and energetic is essential, we can move on stage. We could even jump and everybody would be fine with it (although we recommend not to do it Ballmer style).\nWe saw some speakers deliver killer speeches sitting down or from behind a lectern, not moving at all. At the opposite end, we saw speakers pace energetically on stage and make a great impression. The key is that their posture was coherent with their style, and that when they moved, it was on purpose, not because they could not control their nerves. A good coach will help you understand and build a style that fits your personality, not force you into a predefined stereotypical imaginary \u0026ldquo;ideal presenter\u0026rdquo; (a notion I will develop further in another article).\nFinally, if you\u0026rsquo;re being filmed, avoid moving around too much. It will make good camera work harder. Often the lighting is set to be optimal in a specific location of the stage. Try to stay there.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/06/25/2019-06-25-should-i-move-on-stage-when-speaking/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Oratory","Body Language"],"title":"Should I move on stage when speaking?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"The communication industry is full of myths that are repeated without any scientific backing.

Most people cross their arms because it\u0026rsquo;s a comfortable position, not because they have a mental block, period.\nHowever you should not cross your arms. Just like in many countries, good manners—the etiquette—dictate that we should not put our elbows on the table when we eat, we should not cross our arms when we present, not because it\u0026rsquo;s an actual blocking gesture, but because it\u0026rsquo;s considered inappropriate.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/06/18/2019-06-18-the-body-language-myth-of-crossing-your-arms/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Body language","Presenting"],"title":"The body language myth of crossing your arms"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Ideas on Stage now welcomes you in their Champs Élysées offices. Located in the heart of Paris, they offer the perfect atmosphere to make the best out of your public speaking coaching sessions. And above all, the coffee is very good (although we recommend to avoid it before speaking in public)!\nWhat a change a few years can make. When we created the company, we rented a space in a shared office. But the business center was nearly always full and we had to book the rooms weeks in advance, which was extremely inconvenient. As a young company, we didn’t want to spend too much, so when the first promotion of startups graduated from the Parisian accelerator “Le Camping,” we moved with them in a place called “L’After,” a name that was more reminiscent of a place where spent partygoers would try to recover than a place where you conducted serious business. It was also a bit decrepit, and we had to fight for space between the ping-pong table and the Geeks.\nThis is history. Now we can welcome you in our offices on the Champs Élysées, the most prestigious avenue of Paris, the city of light. It’s easy to find: it’s next to the McDonald’s on the Champs Élysées, and a sign indicates the entrance.\nThere are many rooms, perfect for public speaking coaching and training.

One of these technologies is virtual reality. If you’re in the Paris area, we now have the possibility to supplement our traditional public speaking coaching with virtual reality in combination with our traditional oratory coaching.\nThere are many advantages to using virtual reality. The most obvious one is the ability to simulate a large audience. We always try to make speakers practice in a setting which is as close to the real situation as possible, but assembling 500 people in a room to play the public is simply not feasible. Virtual Reality changes that. It allows the speaker to face a virtual public and learn how to interact with it. The simulation of the emotions of the public will let the orator learn how to stay cool and manage any situation, and how to handle tough questions with confidence.\nThe public speaking virtual reality training simulation can be used in different situations, for example\nPresentation training for your sales team Negotiation training for managers Public speaking training for an internal event In the comfort and discretion of our offices on the Champs Élysées, in the heart of Paris, you will get the most complete public speaking coaching possible.

Yes. Got it. Thanks. Bye.\nRose: Welcome to the Business Presentation Revolution. I\u0026rsquo;m super stressed today because I have a presentation at the end of the day that I\u0026rsquo;m not prepared for. So I\u0026rsquo;ve called my coach to help turn this stress into success.\nMichael: Hey Rose, what\u0026rsquo;s up?\nRose: Michael, I have a presentation at the end of the day. I helped prepare it with my colleagues so I know the slides but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. Do you have any advice for me?\nMichael: Rose. What you need are the three S’s of Success.\nRose: What are those?\nMichael: First things first. Serenity. You\u0026rsquo;re going to stop working. You\u0026rsquo;ve been working very, very hard. Trust the fact that you know it, you know your slides. They\u0026rsquo;re finished. Put down the computer.\nRose: Put down\u0026hellip; put down the computer.\nMichael: Yep. I\u0026rsquo;m telling you to do that.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: Also to be serene, you cannot present effectively drinking coffee. This is really, really bad: coffee, energy drinks\u0026hellip; Put that aside.\nRose: OK.\nMichael: And put your phone on silent.\nRose: You\u0026rsquo;re going a little far, Michael.\nMichael: Put it on silent. Give your brain space to relax. And also, for serenity it’s important with regards to this venue, right?\nRose: Yeah.\nMichael: Get there early.\nRose: Ok. That\u0026rsquo;s okay. I can do that. I can get there early.\nMichael: Now the second S of Success is about Space. When you arrive at that venue tonight, early, make sure you give yourself time to go on stage. Stand up there. If you can, pass your slides, test your videos and have a go at rehearsing on stage. If you can\u0026rsquo;t with a technical team then rehearse by yourself looking at the room in front of you and discovering it.\nRose: That makes sense. OK. I\u0026rsquo;m going to get there early. I can test the stage. I can look at the space.\nMichael: Absolutely, and also know where you\u0026rsquo;re entering from, where you\u0026rsquo;re exiting and where you\u0026rsquo;re going to be placed before you show up on stage, and also know where the water is. In case you get dry mouth or something like that.\nRose: OK. That actually really helps, just to start imagining the space. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it quickly but I think I will go back and I\u0026rsquo;ll check the stage and do exactly like you said: entrances, exits\u0026hellip;\nMichael: Exactly.\nRose: …where am I sitting before I present. I feel pretty good with those two first S\u0026rsquo;s: Serenity, Space. What\u0026rsquo;s the third S?\nMichael: So the third S is basically to seek Support. So, when you get there, seek out who are the technical people lighting you, miking you up, and looking after the slides and the guy who has the clicker. Because these people are great to introduce yourself to, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be looking after you and you\u0026rsquo;re going to feel so much better about doing that.\nRose: Michael, this is making so much sense. It has really helped me calm down and I know our viewers can relate to that moment. So, would you recap these three excellent S\u0026rsquo;s for us?\nMichael: Absolutely. First one: Serenity - find your focus and find your calm. Two: Space - get into the space where you\u0026rsquo;re gonna be presenting. Three: Seek out technical Support. Get to know the guys who are looking after you and making you great on stage.\nSerenity: find your focus and your calm. Space: get into the space where you’re going to present. Support: seek out technical help. Rose: So if you enjoyed what you heard here today, please join the revolution by subscribing to our YouTube channel, iTunes and following us on LinkedIn. We hope to see you next time. Please leave your comments, like, share with your colleagues. And may you stay serene for your next presentation. Thanks again Michael.

With its dramatic zooming and panning effects, it certainly did catch the eye of audiences worldwide when it was introduced. But its over-reliance on movement effects quickly became a visual nuisance, making the audience feel as if they had been on a boat caught in a category 10 hurricane. During the first three years after its launch we got requests for Prezi presentations regularly, but it’s not the case anymore. So what went wrong with Prezi? The core problem of Prezi is simple: it does not address the real problem of PowerPoint. Audiences are not bored because of PowerPoint, but because of how PowerPoint is misused by presenters, and adding more zooming in and out ad nauseam is not going to solve anything. The true remedy to bad PowerPoint presentations lies somewhere else:\nTeaching speakers how to build a compelling narrative for their presentations before opening PowerPoint. Designing slides that effectively reinforce or clarify the speaker’s story. Don’t be mistaken. With the right skills, it is possible to use Prezi to create a great visual story, but for most use cases PowerPoint will be as good or better.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/28/2019-05-28-why-prezi-failed-at-revolutionizing-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["PowerPoint","Prezi","TEDx","Presentation","Slides"],"title":"Why Prezi failed at revolutionizing presentations"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"By now, the last episode of the cult show Game of Thrones has aired. I haven’t seen it, and I didn’t want to see it before writing this article. Whether it accurately follows the storyline of the books or not is a moot point, because said book hasn’t been written yet. And it shows. I won’t spoil anything, don’t worry. But everyone noticed that the screenwriting of the seasons that could rely on George R. R. Martin’s material was much better than the seasons that had to rely on external writers. And I will use that as an example of how important a great storyline is for a great presentation.\nLet’s first look at the material that the showrunners used for the first seasons of Game of Thrones, the books collectively known as “A Song of Ice and Fire,” written by George R. R. Martin (aka GRRM). I’m not a fan of GRRM’s writing style. I find the general style of the sentences a bit “plain.” However, GRRM is exceptional at two things:\nThe storyline. The perfect plot and its twists were what made Game of Thrones what it is. By refusing to follow common writing wisdom in favor of a more complex, realistic and gritty storyline, GRRM created numerous shocks and surprises, but none of them were gratuitous. They were all at the service of the storyline. Short killer lines that could accomplish in a few words what could not have been done in several pages of writing. Take Tyrion, for example. The fact that he is one of the most beloved characters in the series is entirely due to the great lines GRRM put in his mouth. If you compare it to the seasons filmed without GRRM’s books, it’s plain that:\nThe storyline is much more conventional. There are a lot more deus ex machina moments. Some plot twists feel forced and illogical. It’s clear the writers wanted to capture the spirit of GRRM’s writing, but didn’t manage to put their plot twists at the service of the storyline. The short killer lines are gone. Not much more to say. This is why Tyrion feels so useless during these last seasons. What does it mean for your presentations? It means that the storyline always comes first. Everything you say and show has to be directly relevant to the storyline. The storyline will dictate how easy (or how hard) your presentation is to follow. The storyline will dictate how surprising, how impactful your presentation will be.\nThe storyline is not everything, as the short killer lines demonstrate. A presentation is much more: the quality of the delivery, the quality of the visuals, etc. But the storyline is its backbone, and cannot be rushed.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/21/2019-05-21-game-of-thrones-and-the-importance-of-the-storyline/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storyline","Storytelling","Presentations"],"title":"Game of Thrones and the importance of the storyline"},{"author":"","contents":" Transcript Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution! I\u0026rsquo;m here with my colleague Michael Rickwood who\u0026rsquo;s going to be sharing with us what to do with our bodies while presenting.\nSo Michael, our clients regularly ask us: “What do I do with my body, my hands, my face while presenting?” What do you tell your clients?\nRose, what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about is gestures and we all need to use them on stage, but to be better at gestures it\u0026rsquo;s good to know about the four different types of gestures that we can use to be more effective communicators on stage.\nThere are four types of gestures?\nOK, what\u0026rsquo;s the first one? The first ones are called illustrators. Now these are the gestures that you use while you\u0026rsquo;re speaking and these are great for three reasons. The first reason is that it helps people to absorb better what you’re saying. The next reason is because it helps you to channel stress. And the third reason is it helps you to remember your words as you\u0026rsquo;re speaking.\nOkay, so there are some that we\u0026rsquo;re using while we\u0026rsquo;re talking like the Italians do. What\u0026rsquo;s the second type of gesture?\nThe second type of gestures - on a cultural note - are called emblems. These are the gestures that you\u0026rsquo;re using when you don\u0026rsquo;t speak or don\u0026rsquo;t have any words, so gestures that really speak for themselves. So for example Rose you\u0026rsquo;re from the USA. In the USA you have specific nonverbal gestures like that which will work right, like thumbs up or hello goodbye.\nNot every gesture works in every country so that\u0026rsquo;s something to think about. That\u0026rsquo;s really important if you\u0026rsquo;re doing international business. One thing might mean something very positive in one country such as our OK sign in America, and that could mean something very different in another country. So with intercultural communication it\u0026rsquo;s important to have a little coaching on that beforehand.\nAll right, what\u0026rsquo;s our next gesture Michael?\nSo now I want to talk about the face and what we call affect displays. Now the face is very expressive and this is very useful for example with storytelling: we want to tell about a past experience. The face is very important. How can we make the most of it?\nOK, I love that and something that it makes me think of is congruence and how important it is that our facial expressions agree with what we\u0026rsquo;re doing with our body. So if you\u0026rsquo;re telling a positive message, having that effect of a positive expression - a smile etc - and if you\u0026rsquo;re delivering hard news, you might not want to be smiling with a teethy grin.\nRight, kind of like this. But facial expressions also vary from culture to culture. In Latin America and Europe you\u0026rsquo;re going to be much more expressive than for example in Asia.\nAnything else that we should know in terms of gesture types?\nWell there\u0026rsquo;s one more that I haven\u0026rsquo;t spoken about and these are regulators. These are the gestures that you use in order to tell the audience what to do. They\u0026rsquo;re called regulators so it\u0026rsquo;s simply a case of: sit down, stand up, OK everybody please move to the other room. So these gestures are really about interacting and giving orders to the audience and I suppose something a teacher might use quite a lot.\nOK right such as… bring it down.\nOK, perfect!\nMichael, now we know what to do with our body, is there anything we should avoid?\nYes, there are certain gestures that we do that reflect or tell the audience about our negative inner states. These are called parasitical gestures and you should try to avoid them. Things such as playing with your hair or your clothes, wringing your hands together or or anything that\u0026rsquo;s giving those negative feelings away. You can get rid of them by just either working with a coach or just filming yourself and watching it back over to see what you need to eliminate. Pacing unnecessarily is another thing.\nExcellent stuff, thank you Michael. Now we know what to do with our bodies, what to avoid, is there any last tip to share with our viewers?\nAbsolutely. When in doubt, relax. Audiences love that.\nI love it!\nSo, three things to remember:\nOne, there are different types of gestures to use. Experiment. Two, avoid parasitical gestures, doing things unconsciously. Three, when in doubt, relax.\nThank you so much for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Even well-known tech conferences fail to engage their audiences all the time. But medical conferences can be among the worst. Check out this quick interview between Ideas on Stage, new partners with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, and Denise Silber to find out how to take medical (and other) events to the next level.\nOur friend Ross Fisher, a paediatric surgeon based in the UK, has had enough of poor medical communication, and when he’s not operating, he spends time educating doctors about a better way to present. There is a clear need, and Ross is making progress.\nIdeas on Stage has worked with many health-based conferences and events over the years, from internal events for pharma companies to open industry events in nephrology, oncology and other therapeutic areas. It’s clear that our approach to better presentations works very well in this field, and we’ve helped to design several very successful events.\nNow we are adding an extra string to our bow thanks to our partnership with Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You, run by Denise Silber, an experienced bilingual (English/French) event planner and Master of Ceremonies, who is specialized in healthcare communication, and helps organizers to build next-generation events and conferences with patients at the center.\nWe asked Denise some questions about medical conferences, and how our new partnership can help bring them to the next level.\n1. What is wrong with most medical conferences?\nDENISE SILBER: To start with, few physicians say they’re attending their conferences because of the content. They\u0026rsquo;re going to see their colleagues, to take a break from their routine, to visit a new city.\nIt’s a bit like going to the theater for the intermission. And when they do get in the conference room, it’s often “same old, same old”, with slide-based presentations and panels on usual topics or poster sessions…\nThe scientific committee that produces the agenda is likely not following what’s happening in communication and audio-visual techniques. The programs are often not addressing the big shifts in medicine with new technologies and the rise of start-ups, the new role of professionals and patients, the new ethical challenges. And to top it all off, much of the content is available to participants without physically attending.\n2. But surely people expect to sit there and receive lots of top-down detail - how best to meet their expectations while producing a 2.0 kind of conference?\nDS: Yes, people want to receive lots of top-down detail, but, as you know at Ideas on Stage, scientific content can be presented in an engaging or even captivating way.\nMy suggestion is not to change everything at once, but for organizers to go beyond the typical post-conference satisfaction survey and sit down and talk with participants to understand what they did and didn’t like, and then to run with some of the suggestions, to experiment on the least successful parts of their event.\n3. How important is it to include the patient’s point of view in medical events?\nDS: Inviting patients in from the beginning of the planning can make a huge difference. When physicians become patients, they are often very surprised by the experience in their own hospital.\nThe patient reminds us of the real-world viewpoint and of the basic mission of medicine, to help people. They bring irreplaceable testimony to the table. And their presence, both in the sessions and at the breaks, makes for a feel-good, human moment.\n4. What does Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You bring to medical conferences?\nDS: Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You brings new life to medical conferences, thanks to our extensive experience in producing exciting digital health events.\nEach of our clients’ conferences will have special needs and requirements, so we don’t have a formulaic approach. Services include: program and speaker consulting where we bring in novel topics, new speakers, formatting recommendations; creating engagement through a “challenge” or other activity that begins before the event, original demos, and social media articles and deployment. We can guide the conference to a « Patient-Included » certification, which can be transformative. This involves inviting patients to the organizing table, as part of the agenda, and in the room.\n5. Why partner with Ideas on Stage to help transform medical events?\nDS: This partnership is quite easy to understand. Ideas on Stage has extensive experience in business events, in presentation creation, and coaching public speakers in any industry. Doctors 2.0 \u0026amp; You is focused on healthcare, where we are recognized for producing quality programs related to the latest in digital innovation and involving patients. We each have an expertise that needs daily practice to stay in shape. Together we can make medical events even more original and powerful.\n6. Finally, if you had one piece of advice for event organizers, what would it be?\nDS: Advice for an event organizer in healthcare?

Ultimately, we were talking about inspiring a shift in culture. We gathered as much information as we could before wrapping up the meeting with quick sips of coffee to match Chavy’s speedster-pace.\nThis is how the project started — for us. But Chavy and his team had kicked-off planning the conference that summer, more than 8 months before the event would take place. Not everyone starts this well in advance. But let me assure you, it pays off.\nAt Ideas on Stage, we’ve had the pleasure of helping clients from practically all sectors bring creative and substantial presentations and events to life many times over. This was going to be a fun challenge given how out-of-the-box the client wanted to be in achieving the fundamental goals: inspire employee pride, reignite team unity and accelerate innovation to succeed in today’s world. Fueled up, we sent Chavy a proposal for our plan forward. He agreed and we put pedal to the metal.\nThe Challenge Normally, we need to consider some or all of the following elements in designing an event: budget, location, scheduling, possible discrepancies between organizers’ objectives and audience needs, overcoming bad presentation habits like death-by-PowerPoint, and harmonizing key messages across speakers and workshops.\nFor Mövenpick’s conference, our top risk was message-related. We needed to step out of ‘business as usual’, while not overstretching general managers’ sensibilities to create a snap-back. GMs impact everything from sales to front-office operations, so we needed to avoid the risk of destabilizing them and in turn, their team and guests. We needed to strike a warm tone with a clear ‘why’ supporting the call for a shift in culture. We needed to be glued to the question: what (in this culture shift) is in it for them?\nThe managers were coming from all around the world, an array of cultures and in many cases a relatively classic business paradigm. So, how would we effectively disrupt older assumptions and enroll them in an update across all touch-points in their hotels?\nThere were also scheduling and location constraints. Plus, conflicting conferences happening in the same time period, which GMs would need to attend. So how did we mitigate said risks and optimize opportunity in our planning?\nThe Solution Step one: align key stakeholders. To do this, we facilitated a full-day brainstorm in Geneva with their executive committee, or I should say, both of them. Chavy had recently engaged a shadow ExCom-Y team powered by millennials. During this synergistic gathering, Phil Waknell and I took the diverse group through Ideas on Stage methodology to synchronize objectives, distill key messages and capture creative ideas.\nThere were many questions to be asked, but first things first: we always start with our ABCs; of course I don’t mean the alphabet. We begin by gathering all there is to know regarding the specific Audience — the GMs in this case; their Burning Needs — what did they need out of this conference? And the Context — where and when exactly will the conference take place? Audience, Burning Needs, Context.\nSince that full day in Geneva it was clear we were working with a special group. Chavy and his team were not just talking about transformation, they were walking the change. To assure highest impact, they decided it was worth bringing in an external partner to keep things on target and provide fresh insight.\nThe day wrapped up with a succulent dinner in the heart of Geneva. (Mövenpick knows how to tie everything together with a beautiful moment.) This kind of generosity and attention to detail wove throughout the next 6 months until the final applause at the end of their conference.\nBetween that day and the event on April 25th, many steps were taken to ensure the success of this event. Here are the super six takeaways which you can put into practice now:\nDefine a clear objective and tie it together with a theme. We decided early on about larger organizing elements, such as the theme of the conference, which would harmonize our main objective across a full 3-day line-up of presentations and workshops. We needed something that would inspire an internal culture change towards being faster, more connected, performance-oriented and having fun. A theme for rethinking the possible and changing gears with changing times. The theme: “SHIFT 2018” Add an inspirational gem. We gathered candidates for external speakers that would elevate our theme and draw insightful real-world connections. Who would represent best-in-class performance, efficiency, collaboration and all with a heart-pumping story of optimism and appetite for adventure? The speaker: ace solo sailor Alex Thomson, 2nd place Vendée Globe Champion Schedule and sync with presenters well in advance. To be sure all workshops and presentations were coherent, unique, memorable and impactful, we scheduled on average two hours of coaching with each contributor, of which there were a good 30 across the 2-day agenda. There were TED-inspired keynotes, panels, a live press briefing (one of the client’s many brilliant ideas), interactive workshops, and 10min lightning talks. The success of an event is determined before it begins. Given the packed agenda and the client’s commitment to success, we deployed the needed resources: two Speaker Coaches, a Master of Ceremonies, plus a Design Director all onsite for the entire event including rehearsals the day before. The takeaway: You can’t prepare too early, too well, or too much. Sprinkle on special touches. From the moment participants arrived the night before they were greeted with thoughtful gifts in their rooms, including products they were being asked to adopt in their hotels. There was also a surprise pair of Converse sports shoes, in the right size, which the normally shined-shoe crew were certainly not expecting. They were told that without their sneakers they couldn’t take a step into the conference. This was a true hit and left a memorable impression on everyone as a symbolic feature representing their unity as a team, accentuating the need for speed and fun. Other high-end touches included shifting gears on two F1 simulators, test-riding a pair of TESLA driverless cars and, to conclude the conference, an afternoon treasure-hunt that sent the whole 130-plus international pack out into the streets of Zurich to explore Movenpick’s Swiss roots at a competitive pace. The reviews: they laughed, they played, and they performed as a united global team. Add the unexpected. Make it memorable by making it meaningful, different and fun. Not every company or event will have a budget to offer gifts or to eat gourmet food and sip coffee-cocktails during breaks. However, that shouldn’t stop you from offering new experiences or thoughtful touches that “make moments” for your participants that are authentic to your culture. The tip: consider what matters to your team, then be generous. Visuals matter. Slide design and space were key in the success of this event. Too many conferences invest time and money in other important areas but forget the essential role of visuals to support key messages on stage. Movenpick limited text to under 10words/slide and asked presenters to make decks as graphic, clear and simple as possible. When speakers needed a creative boost, we were there to design and animate with them. The key: visuals matter, from slides to attire and certainly the event space. Speaking of the actual space, Movenpick broke the mold and accentuated their culture shift within their hotel design by putting participants in a more modern yet homey setup. Couches and armchairs replaced stiff banquet seating, reflecting the future feel of their lobbies.\nEvents are not brain science. It’s about starting early and being thorough from the bottom to the top. You need the right materials and a clear plan to build a masterpiece.\nInvolve key stakeholders. Work from your core objectives and add layers of meaning and originality in stages. Above all, stay true to who you are as an organization. Authenticity is key.\nOne more thing. What made Movenpick’s SHIFT 2018 conference truly amazing, was that the leadership team and organizers continuously put themselves in the shoes of their audience: the GMs. They thought from their perspective and their needs. Serve your audience and you will smile at the results.\nChavy’s event team took risks to walk their talk: they were honest, dynamic and prepared enough to let loose on D-Day. It was clear that they were proud to work at Movenpick, and that pride was reflected in their audience.\nSo, in organizing your next event, we hope you feel clearer and more inspired about how to approach it. And, if you’d like some experienced partners to help guide you on the journey, you know where to find us.\nThe Results Here is a brief interview with Olivier Chavy two weeks after SHIFT 2018:\nHow did you feel the event went from a leadership perspective? The overall atmosphere of the conference was what we were most interested in and we wanted people to leave with the sensation ‘wow, I am really proud to work for this company’. The reactions we have received so far lead us to believe this was a mission accomplished!\nWhat did your general managers have to say about the event? The most common feedback has been that this was the best GM conference they have ever attended, which is fantastic. Most delegates commented that they liked the unusual format of short, sharp sessions – not too long sitting in a hall and no numbers presented.\nWhat made SHIFT a memorable experience? The whole ambiance made it memorable but there were a lot of memorable ‘little touches’ that came together to achieve this. From everyone wearing Converse high top shoes, to the newspaper we created, to the cool partners who presented, to the Swiss cow-bell awards…. We took some risks and did things differently and it paid off.\nWhen did you start planning the conference and why did you bring in Ideas on Stage to support you? We started planning initially in summer 2017 but the real work began in October/November that year. We decided to bring Ideas on Stage on board as we knew we didn’t want to do a ‘traditional’ conference and we would need professional assistance to stage manage, coach our speakers and plan the sessions.\nHow did working with Ideas on Stage help in realizing the event? It was critical – we would not have achieved the impact we did without them. Every one of our speakers was coached and guided into how to make the most of their session, all content was aligned to ensure the messages we wanted were passed, they came up with great ideas for transitions, flow of sessions, themes. We are really pleased we brought them on board.\nWere you surprised by any aspect of the event, before, during or after? We were surprised that we could enjoy it and not stress too much, it went really smoothly.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/15/2019-05-15-what-makes-an-amazing-culture-shifting-event/","summary":"","tags":["Events","Culture Shift","Tips","Learning","Case Study"],"title":"What Makes an Amazing, Culture-Shifting Event?"},{"author":"The Ideas on Stage team","contents":"A big part of the way many companies sell is to create a presentation that shows the complex benefits of the solution they are offering.\nBut even great businesses — which are very good at what they do — often lack the ability to clearly share their message to their target audience using presentations.\nThere are many reasons why people and companies want to improve their presentations but at the heart of it what they really want is to win more deals, get more customers and sell more.\nIn our 10-year experience of successfully helping many of the world’s leading companies sell more through radically better business presentations, there are three ingredients you must have in order to make effective presentations:\n1.

But I think it is sometimes given by coaches without thinking about the consequences, and that it can actually do more bad than good. Let me explain why.\nThe first reason is simply that not every speaker needs to speak slowly. Speaking slowly is done for several reasons, such as increasing the perceived gravitas (authority) or allowing the public to digest complex information more easily. But sometimes it’s simply not necessary and may actually reduce the effectiveness of the speech. If speaking fast is not detrimental to the clarity of the speech—that is, every word is easy to understand—and as long as the speed doesn’t make the amount of information unbearable for the listener, the first priority of a coach may not be to force a speaker to consciously slow down.\nThe second reason is that some people can be completely destabilized when forced to speak slower. It breaks a lot of things: the rhythm, the way words are articulated, the intonation, the energy in the voice, the link between the mouth muscles and the brain. This is why people who try to slow down may sound so awkward and unnatural. They are not used to it. It’s relatively easy to speak slower, it’s very hard to do so and remain natural and authentic.\nThe third reason why speaking slowly may not be good advice is that it may not be that relevant after all. The average speed at which orators speak has increased over time. Listen to a speech from Churchill, Martin Luther King or General de Gaulle and compare it to a recent speech, you should easily hear the dramatic difference in pace. Modern speeches tend to be delivered faster. Modern adverts or YouTubers speak even faster, yet manage to catch our attention and communicate clearly. Our era is so crowded with distractions every second of attention has become a luxury that cannot be wasted.\nFor master speakers, the ability to slow down or pick up pace naturally is extremely valuable, but it requires a lot of work and dedication. When there is little time to prepare, it’s more important to teach a speaker how to remain natural, authentic and passionate, and this is achieved much more easily by teaching how to speak in sync with the audience than to force someone to consciously slow down.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/05/07/2019-05-07-should-you-actually-slow-down-your-speech-when-you-present/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Tips"],"title":"Should you actually slow down your speech when you present?"},{"author":"","contents":"Powerful visuals come from powerful messages and clear visual ideas. But sometimes slides aren’t necessary. The days of ‘Death by PowerPoint®’ are over. Take 5 to discover the 3 simple steps to slide success that will help you achieve your objectives—and leave your audience wanting more—in our new episode of The Business Presentation Revolution podcast, with presentation experts Rose Bloomfield and Phil Waknell.\nTranscript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution: your colorful cocktail of presentation goodness.\nPhil: [00:00:06] Today we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on slides. Why most slides fail and three steps to make sure yours succeed.\nRose: [00:00:16] So today people really don\u0026rsquo;t like PowerPoint and there\u0026rsquo;s good reason for that. In fact, maybe we should just stop using it?\nPhil: [00:00:24] Well we could and in fact a lot of presentations would work very well without any visual aids. And it\u0026rsquo;s much better for a presentation to have no slides than to have bad slides. But if people hate PowerPoint and the other slide technologies it\u0026rsquo;s not because of the technologies themselves. It\u0026rsquo;s because of the way they are used. And if you think that a good slide is just a whole bunch of bullet points behind you, well you can understand your audience not liking that. So, I think you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;throw out the baby with the bathwater\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s not the tool, it\u0026rsquo;s the fool who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to use it that\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nRose: [00:01:01] Great. So Phil, you promised us three techniques for slide success. What\u0026rsquo;s the first one?\nPhil: [00:01:08] So the first one is to always remember that you\u0026rsquo;ve got to make sure you know what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say before you start to think about your slides. The slides should illustrate what you\u0026rsquo;re saying. You are not there to comment on the slides that are behind you.\nRose: [00:01:25] OK. So first step: speech before slides. What\u0026rsquo;s the second step?\nPhil: [00:01:30] Well the second step is not to get your computer involved too early. In fact what you really need to do is to switch off your computer when you start thinking about the slides. You first think about the story, we\u0026rsquo;ve already done that. But then you think, \u0026ldquo;how do I want to illustrate that?\u0026rdquo; And you do it analog. You do it with some sticky notes or with a whiteboard or whatever, but then you can imagine what you would want to have as a visual aid to help your audience. And only then can you start designing it in your slide application of choice.\nRose: [00:02:04] Perfect. Okay, step one: speech before slides. Step two: analog storyboard first. In fact, at Ideas on Stage, the presentation directors or coaches tend to create a storyboard first, based on the key messages of our speakers, and then we deliver it to the designer. The designer is the one that makes it beautiful in PowerPoint only once we have a clear idea of where we\u0026rsquo;re going visually. So we have the first and second step. Phil, what\u0026rsquo;s our third step?\nPhil: [00:02:33] Well the third step, Rose, is absolutely to remember that slides are not documents. So yesterday I was giving a class for a business school and one of the people in the audience said that she really hates it when people confuse slides and documents. When they confuse PowerPoint with Word. And this is a problem. We often produce really bad slides because we think we can kill two birds with one stone. Like the slide that is going to be on the wall behind us while we\u0026rsquo;re speaking is also a document that we can distribute before or during or after the presentation. And you know what? Slides don\u0026rsquo;t make good documents and documents don\u0026rsquo;t make good slides. The more text you put up there in an attempt to make it useful for someone reading afterwards, well you know what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen? The audience will try to read; and human beings cannot read and listen at the same time. Right?\nRose: [00:03:31] Absolutely.\nPhil: [00:03:32] Not even ladies can do that Rose, can they?\nRose: [00:03:34] No, I know we\u0026rsquo;re great multitaskers, but it\u0026rsquo;s pretty hard to do both at the same time. So we have three successful steps for designing effective slides. One: speech before the slides. Two: analog storyboard first. Three: don\u0026rsquo;t confuse your slides with a document. So separate those two.\nPhil: [00:03:57] So once we\u0026rsquo;ve understood that your slides are only visual aids during our presentation and that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to distribute them because we have documents, well then we can design them effectively. But that is for another show.\nRose: [00:04:10] So thank you for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We have a lot more to share with you about delivery and slides.

Now, Gizmodo is not exactly known as a staple of great journalism, but sometimes they have a knack to hit the nail on the head. In this case, the fact that for several years Elon Musk repeatedly promised—and failed to deliver—full autonomous driving. Honestly, s eeing how hard it is to achieve full autonomy, and how many problems are left with Tesla’s current autopilot system, it is hard to believe these new promises will actually materialize.\nBut what interests me here is the relationship between what we promise and how that affects our credibility. Whenever we present, it’s easy and sexy to (over) sell grand visions of a glorious future. It makes us feel good to be that visionary genius. There’s just one problem. If we don’t deliver, then we’re just freeing a pack of wild dogs that one day will come back to bite us. This is exactly the trap in which Elon Musk has fallen.\nHe is not alone. During his first tenure at Apple, Steve Jobs was known for always over-inflating sales predictions, and failing to meet them. The lackluster sales of Macintosh compared to his promises were one of the reasons for his downfall. It would take him another failure, NeXT, and again another one with the Mac Cube, to drastically change his approach and start to under-promise, over-deliver.\nThe overpromise, under-deliver approach is typical of startups, because the competition is so fierce to stand out and gain an edge against the competition that it is sometimes necessary to have blind faith in your own vision. But Tesla is not a little startup anymore, and Elon Musk needs to change the way he communicates about it. He should start to under-promise and over-deliver. If he does so, it will be very easy for him to reclaim the lost credibility.\nHe’s totally capable of it. In fact, what is truly confounding is that he is already doing it brilliantly with Space X. He’s achieved a huge breakthrough in space technology, yet does not hesitate to warn before each launch that chances of failure remain extremely high. Under-promise, over-deliver.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/30/2019-04-30-is-elon-musk-running-out-of-credibility/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Business"],"title":"Is Elon Musk running out of credibility?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"This is a quick list of seven common problems that we see with slides created by non specialists. However they are relatively easy to spot, and you don’t have to be a graphic designer to avoid them. Read on and your next slides will look much better!\nToo much content. The goal is not to cover every single inch with content. It’s not because you have some space left at the bottom of the slide that you should put something there. Leave ample white space, let your content breathe, it will give it importance. Irrelevant content. Now that you removed clutter, it’s time to ask yourself if the remaining content is really, really, really necessary and relevant to your presentation and to what you are going to say. Irrelevant content will just distract and confuse your audience. Content is too small. The basic rule is: if it’s too small to be readable, don’t put it on the slide. What’s the point of adding text in 9 points that nobody will be able to read? Even if relevant, if it cannot be read by your audience then it’s just visual noise. When designing your slides, take the size of the room and of the screen into account. If you are young don’t forget that older people often don’t see as well as you do, and need bigger text and graphics. Illogical visual flow. We have seen slides that put the key information in the bottom right corner. Or slides that had to be read bottom to top. Try to avoid those layouts if possible, in Western culture it’s preferable to put the most important elements at the top or center of the slide. Insufficient contrast. What looks legible on your high quality screen may look washed out on old projectors or brightly lit rooms. Always make sure that you have excellent contrast between background and content. Avoid busy backgrounds which reduce legibility. Don’t forget that white text, not colored text, is what offers the highest contrast on a dark background. Boring looking. You will just make your life unnecessary hard if you try to use boring, plain slides to keep your audience interested. Using beautiful pictures, original graphics, a small dose of animation and a few surprises will be much more efficient! Comic Sans. Please, don’t use that font. Even as a joke. Just don’t.

She’s the author of the Pyramid Principle, a book that was long considered, and sometimes still is, the gold standard of presentation structuring in the consulting industry. But it was back in the eighties. So I’ll dare to ask the question: is the pyramid principle outdated?\nIf you’re not familiar with the pyramid principle, it is a method to lay out the information in a presentation in the most efficient way possible, based on how people with little time, especially executives, absorb information. For example, one of the key techniques is to start by presenting the conclusion first, because the CEO doesn’t want to wait until the end to understand where you’re going. This, and the other techniques in the book, are still valid. They still work today. However, they are no longer sufficient to win the deal in the twenty-first century. Let me explain why.\nThe pyramid principle is an extremely logical approach. But recent research, and honestly, what the best presenters and showmen have always known, is that presentations need more than logic and information. They need emotion to be truly effective and have a lasting impact. This is where the pyramid principle falls short. We’re not just brains. We’re living humans, with our knowledge, our beliefs, our feelings, our emotions, our hopes, our fears. None of these parts can work independently from the others. Seemingly innocuous information can create fear or hope. Our audience’s beliefs—for example that centralization is a good or bad thing—can hugely influence the outcome of a presentation.\nThis is the key reason why we developed the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool, to make sure that presentations don’t treat an audience as a collection of isolated brains, but as what they are: humans. Let me show you how much of a difference that makes by going quickly through the four areas that the Audience Transformation Roadmap tool addresses:\nWhat people know: this is the rational information. It’s what the pyramid principle does brilliantly. What people think: this is what people think they know, but hasn’t been backed by facts. It touches on our beliefs, the rumor we heard, the “fact” that was repeated but never demonstrated. If you take the time to adapt your communication to what people think, you will instantly understand how to overcome some of the mental blocks of your audience. No more frustration because people seem to be totally deaf to your recommendations. What people feel: can you imagine how many politicians, how many top CEOs, how many celebrities would have been saved from huge embarrassment, or worse, from a debacle, if they had taken the time to take their audience’s feelings into account before speaking. What people do: too many presentations stop at “we said what we wanted to say.” It’s completely insufficient. This is what leads to: “Our presentation was great but they didn’t do what we expected” (didn’t buy, didn’t implement, didn’t sign off, didn’t whatever you wanted). But if you take the time to clearly define what you want people do after the presentation, then you can have a plan. The pyramid principle is an excellent tool to communicate logical information, but it doesn’t really take into account how humans actually work. It’s like trying to drive a car by just steering the wheel with the engine shut off. It’s not going to get you very far. By addressing your audience as humans, not machines, you will dramatically increase your chances of reaching your goal.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/16/2019-04-16-is-barbara-minto-s-pyramid-principle-outdated/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling","Consulting","Business"],"title":"Is Barbara Minto’s pyramid principle outdated?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Recently my computer, a MacBook Pro, needed to be repaired. I had to do without a laptop for several weeks. And of course, during those weeks I needed to present with slides. Luckily, with my iPhone and a couple of accessories I had everything I needed:\nA (not too old) iPhone or iPad A lightning to HDMI adapter A lightning power cable and brick (using the HDMI adapter drains the battery fast). Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote for iOS Optionally, a Logitech Spotlight remote. Both Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote work like their computer cousins, and support all animations. I loaded my presentation on my iPhone, connected it to the screen using the HDMI adapter, and voilà! Probably the fastest and easiest way to project something. Even cooler, the iPhone supports the Logitech Spotlight presentation remote via Bluetooth, so I could use it to go advance the slides.\nThe only downside is that an iPhone screen is very small for my old eyes, and I had to turn my back to the audience from time to time to see where I was in the presentation. But it worked flawlessly.\nIf you have a critical presentation to deliver, using your iPhone as a backup is an excellent way to fight Murphy’s Law, and have a safety net in case something goes wrong with your computer.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/09/2019-04-09-use-your-iphone-as-backup-for-important-presentations/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Microsoft PowerPoint","Apple Keynote","iPhone"],"title":"Use your iPhone as backup for important presentations"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"Seth Godin coined the term “meatball sundae” several years ago in a book that explained that putting two great things together does not always create something better. And in the worst case, such as a meatball sundae, it can actually create something nobody wants.\nThe meatball sundae presentation effect can happen at two levels: at the event level, and at the individual presentation level.\nLet’s take Apple’s latest keynote as an example of the meatball sundae effect at the event level. Apple is a great meatball. Hollywood A-stars are great sundaes. But put together, the tastes of the two clashed in a way that was obvious to the most casual observers.\nWe can all learn something from what happened. Apple failed to create a fantastic event with the appearance of stars such as Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Aniston. In fact, it was a worse event compared to their usual standards. So why would hiring a star magically turn our events into something fantastic? The answer is simple: it doesn’t. More prestigious? Yes. Better and more interesting? Not necessarily.\nA star can make your event better, if, and that’s a big if, properly selected and prepared. This is why, whenever we design an event, we take extra steps to ensure that your A-list guests do not taste like the meatball in the sundae. We check that they are willing to do their homework, prepare properly and that they will adapt to your audience. This makes a world of difference.\nAt the individual presentation level, the meatball sundae effect is very real too, especially when we try to cram to much stuff into too little time. Does the presentation deliver information that is at the same time too complex for non-experts and too simple for real experts? Meatball sundae presentation. Is the storyline trying to follow too many different structures and logical paths? Meatball sundae story. Does it mix different visual styles that don’t go well together? Meatball sundae slides.\nMeatball sundae presentations are often the consequence of a poorly done ABC: knowing who the Audience is (A), what are their Burning needs (B) and what is the general Context (C). These elements have to be crystal clear before working on the story, or the presentation will lack focus and seem out of place.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/04/02/2019-04-02-the-meatball-sundae-presentation-e/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Preparation"],"title":"The meatball sundae presentation effect"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"It may sound weird, but this is a question we get asked from time to time: “Do you know a prescription drug that would help me reduce my stress on stage?”\nWe’re not talking about illegal drugs, but legal drugs sold in pharmacies. There are a lot of those designed by pharmaceutical companies to reduce stress, anxiety, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, etc. We are not doctors, so we cannot say anything about them from a medical perspective. But in the context of presentations, we don’t recommend any. We met a few people who unfortunately thought they couldn’t do without them. Looking back at their performance, we don’t think the drugs had any positive effect. They may have thought that it improved their performance on stage, but it didn’t. As the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Nile Rodgers once explained in an interview in the Guardian:\n“(…) My drugs made me think it was amazing. The people freaking out made me think it was amazing. My beautiful date made me think it was amazing. But the tapes don’t lie. It was not amazing. (\u0026hellip;)” —Nile Rodgers\nOf course Nile Rodgers was probably referring to something a bit stronger than Aspirin, but his lesson remains true for any kind of stage performance. Great presentation delivery requires your full presence and an authentic connection with the audience. Drugs will only set you off balance and give you a distorted view of reality, preventing you from being yourself, centered and focused on the moment.\nIn fact, you already may be taking a drug that makes things worse: coffee. Find out why that’s not a good idea in this short podcast.\nAfter working with thousands of speakers, our message is clear: you don’t need drugs to present successfully, but you do need energy. A good presentation coach will help you turn your fear into positive energy, helping you achieve full presence on stage, and giving your messages the power they—and your audience—deserve.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/03/26/2019-03-26-is-there-a-drug-to-get-rid-of-my-fear-of-public-speaking/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear","Stage fright"],"title":"Is there a drug to get rid of my fear of public speaking?"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"It’s a trick I learned when studying how movies and TV shows are written. You don’t do a flash back, you do a flash present. For presentations, that means that you don’t tell the story as something that is over; that makes the audience passive. Instead, you bring the scene from the past into the present, or you bring the audience to the past, and tell it as if it is happening right now. This allows the audience to actively relive the scene as it happened, and is a much more effective way to tell stories.\nLet me give you an example to show you the difference. Imagine you want to talk about that “aha” moment you had several years ago when you found the big idea to create your company.\nFirst, the flash back version, told as something that happened in the past: “In 2005, I had the idea to create my company. It was about creating a platform to engage users by sharing social content based on pictures only. I had the idea during a discussion with two friends. At the time most social platforms forced users to use text…”\nNow the flash present version, told as something happening now: “let’s all go back to 2005. I am having a beer with two friends. I’m complaining about how social media forces me to write something for every post. One of my friends, you know, the blunt one, tells me ‘then why don’t you create a platform where it is impossible to write something?’”…\nNote that it is possible to use the past tense (I was having a discussion…) as long as you make the public relive the scene instead of telling about it as something that is over. Where a flashback is factual and flat, a flash present is engaging and dynamic. For master storytellers, each detail matters. This technique makes a big difference when engaging your audience.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/03/19/2019-03-19-in-presentations-dont-do-a-flash/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Storytelling","Tips"],"title":"In presentations, don’t do a flash back, do a flash present"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"This March Andrea Pacini joined Ideas on Stage as UK Presentation Director, meaning that Ideas on Stage now has a direct presence in France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom - and we serve the rest of the world from these four locations.\nWe sat down with Andrea for a short interview.\nQ: What is your background? A: I am Italian, and I studied in Italy and Ireland. I then did an internship in Cambridge, where I fell in love with the UK and decided to stay there. I’ve been living in London for 6 years now. From a professional perspective, my background is sales and business development for international companies. In parallel I have worked to help others deliver great presentations.\nQ: What made you so interested in helping others deliver great presentations? A: The moment was ten years ago, when I read Presentation Zen by Garr Reynolds. This is when I realized there was so much more than just PowerPoint. But more than that, I’ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur. As a kid, I used to follow people like Richard Branson, trying to learn the tips and tricks to be successful. I still read a lot of business books. I then realized that all great entrepreneurs are top communicators. And that’s when I switched my interest from pure entrepreneurship to presentations. It then led me to the realization that most business presentations suck! This is why I decided to help business people improve their presentations. What really fires me up, my passion, is the place where business intersects with communication.\nQ: What made you want to join the Ideas on Stage team? A: Like I said, Presentation Zen helped to open my eyes to what the potential of a well thought out and designed presentation could look like. Fine. But the entrepreneur in me wanted to apply this wisdom in business situations. This is how I came to discover Ideas on Stage. With their business backgrounds, Pierre and Phil and their great team pioneered the path of taking Presentation Zen principles and applying them to the entrepreneurial and business space. This ticked both my boxes. Then as a bonus, I discovered the close relationship between Garr and Ideas on Stage. So when I finally decided to turn my presentation hobby into a new career, joining Ideas on Stage was the best-case scenario for me. And I was right – we are so closely aligned that it seems like we have been working together for many years already.\nQ: Do you prefer to work with smaller or bigger companies? A: It doesn’t really matter, I love to work with both! The challenges are different, but all companies, regardless of their size, have a big weakness in the preparation phase. Everybody starts working on their presentation by opening PowerPoint, and forget that they first have to know what their objective is, identify the key messages and build a storyline before working on the slides.\nQ: Do you think the preparation phase is where most companies fail? A: Definitely. You really have to start by understanding who is your audience, what do they want from you, what’s the context of the presentation, what’s your objective, how are you going to brainstorm to refine your key messages? The preparation phase is really where the magic happens. Especially in large companies, people think a presentation is a bunch of bullet points in PowerPoint.\nQ: Is there anything companies could learn from events like TEDx? A: Oh yes, TEDx has been instrumental in helping to improve presentations. So why not take the ingredients that make a TEDx speech so engaging, and apply them to your business presentations? Business presentations don’t have to be boring! Of course a successful boardroom presentation won’t be exactly like a TEDx talk, but like TEDx it should be short, simple, well-structured, with good use of examples, and delivered convincingly.\nQ: Something else you are passionate about? A: I love craft beer! You know, beers produced by microbreweries. Just like every presentation should be original and different, with a focus on quality not quantity, I think the same way about beer! I love to discover different beers, and I go to beer tours to find new and original tastes.\nThank you and welcome Andrea, we’re delighted to have you on board.

Would you put the cart before the horse? Most people do. But fear not, the latest episode of the Business Presentation Revolution Podcast is here to help! Take just five minutes to learn about the simple change that will put the horse before the cart, and you in the driver’s seat. Join Rose as she discusses a foolproof process to prepare a presentation with Phil Waknell, Co-Founder and Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage.\nTranscript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your quick coffee break to learn how to shake up and wake up your presentations. [00:00:06][5.8]\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at one of the smallest but most important changes you can make to make a huge difference in your presentations. And it\u0026rsquo;s all about putting “the horse” before “the cart”. [00:00:16][9.5]\nRose: [00:00:20] You just mentioned “carts” and “horses”: what does that have to do with presentations? [00:00:24][3.4]\nPhil: [00:00:25] Well Rose, you\u0026rsquo;ve heard the expression \u0026lsquo;putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;, which is generally something you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do. But that\u0026rsquo;s what we do all the time when we\u0026rsquo;re preparing presentations. The typical way to prepare a business presentation is: \u0026ldquo;Oh no, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to do a presentation. Tomorrow. And it\u0026rsquo;s 11:30 at night. OK, so I am going to open my computer. I am going to type my PowerPoint slides and 50 slides later, I then think, OK, maybe I need some extra sub-bullets or whatever.\u0026rdquo; And then what happens is the next day you get into the meeting room, you say hi to everybody, you connect your computer, you start showing your slides, you turn your back on the audience, you read your bullet points, and then you improvise because you haven\u0026rsquo;t prepared what you\u0026rsquo;re going to say. You end up with a whole lot of information and it\u0026rsquo;s boring as hell for the participants. I mean, how do you feel when you\u0026rsquo;re in that audience? [00:01:15][50.3]\nRose: [00:01:17] Well, unfortunately, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been there before and you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the emails you still have to answer. You\u0026rsquo;re thinking about the groceries you need to buy tonight, and why didn\u0026rsquo;t this guy prepare? Here I am and where is he? [00:01:29][12.2]\nPhil: [00:01:30] Absolutely. So you think you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared the presentation but actually you\u0026rsquo;ve not. You\u0026rsquo;ve just prepared some bullet points, which your audience is going to hate and which they\u0026rsquo;re going to forget very quickly. So that is not a proper preparation, but it is ‘putting the cart before the horse\u0026rsquo;. So, if you think about it, ‘putting the cart before the horse’ is going through the process in the wrong direction. What we should be doing is putting the horse before the cart and that means we need to work out what we have to say to our audience, and then afterwards we think: \u0026ldquo;do I need to illustrate that? And if so, how?\u0026rdquo; So preparation for a presentation, especially if you\u0026rsquo;ve got limited time - because people always say to us: \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to prepare my presentation properly, so I just have to prepare my slides.\u0026rdquo; No. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a short time, then what you should do is to be thinking: Who is my audience? What are their needs? What are my objectives? And what are the few things they need to remember a week later for me to achieve those objectives? And then you\u0026rsquo;ve got your key messages. You understand your objectives, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have slides you\u0026rsquo;re prepared. If you have your slides but you don\u0026rsquo;t know your key messages, you\u0026rsquo;re not prepared. [00:02:44][74.2]\nRose: [00:02:45] That\u0026rsquo;s it. And luckily we face this all the time at Ideas on Stage, so we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a very simple four step process. One: you ideate. What is this going to be about? What do I need to say? Like Phil mentioned: objectives, key messages. Two: you need to create your presentation. Write it out. Write your storyline. Three: ask yourself: \u0026ldquo;Do I need illustrations? Do I need slides?\u0026rdquo; If you do then you make them! If you don\u0026rsquo;t, fine. Especially in those tight moments when you only have one night to prepare, you might not need the slides. Four: delivery; speaking. That\u0026rsquo;s when you can start to time yourself and check if you know what you need to say ahead. And your audience will thank you. [00:03:31][46.7]\nPhil: [00:03:32] That makes a huge, huge difference. So I will always say rehearsal is necessary. Slides are optional. So if you go into a meeting, if you go into a presentation and you don\u0026rsquo;t have any PowerPoint slides but you do have clear messages and you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable in front of your audience because you have rehearsed it two, three, four, five times then your audience will actually enjoy that far more than a whole load of bullet points behind you. [00:04:00][27.7]\nRose: [00:04:00] Yep. So let\u0026rsquo;s put the \u0026lsquo;horse BEFORE the cart\u0026rsquo;. Prepare. You\u0026rsquo;ve got Ideation, Creation, maybe Illustration and then Speaking and you\u0026rsquo;ll be set. [00:04:09][8.8]\nPhil: [00:04:10] As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.\u0026quot; Creating a lot of slides and bullet points without knowing what you want to say is not preparation, that\u0026rsquo;s an absence of preparation. So if you prepare it properly, if you go into the meeting knowing what you need to say, knowing your objectives, even without slides, you will succeed and your audience will thank you.

This is the reason you, and not somebody else, is on stage to deliver the presentation. The second stake is about your audience: why is it important for them? This is the reason why your audience is there to listen to you instead of doing something else. This is why they should care about your topic. The third stake is about everyone else: why does it truly matter outside of the audience and you? What is the impact of your topic on the world? If you forget the first stake, then you will not feel engaged. If you forget the second stake, then your audience will not be interested. If you forget the third stake, then nobody else will care about your presentation.\nTake for example a talk about the environmental impact of plastic bottles. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care about that topic, you don\u0026rsquo;t have the first stake. Most probably you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be on stage. The second stake is about \u0026ldquo;why is the topic of plastic bottles important for you, the audience?\u0026rdquo; Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s so we each realize how much plastic we waste each year. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because it has direct consequences on our health. The third stake brings perspective. It shows that the problem is not just about a bunch of people in the room, but impacts everyone, even living organisms that are located thousands of kilometers from where the bottle was thrown away. These organisms are essential for our own survival.\nGreat presentations are delivered by someone who cares, to people who will care, about something worth caring about.

We’ve seen many speakers who were very good at giving unstructured talks, or 1h presentations, or improvise during a round table. But giving a TEDx Talk requires a whole different level of commitment and preparation. Make sure your speaker understands what is expected of him. Constantly changing the key topic, storyline or angle. Some speakers seem to be unable to discipline themselves to stick to the planned storyline. They constantly change their mind. After several weeks of preparation they come up with draft version 2453 of their talk, but it’s not better than draft version 1. And on D Day, they want to change their story again. Not putting in the necessary hours to prepare. Nobody can deliver a breakthrough talk without preparing and rehearsing properly. It’s just not possible. Those speakers doing OK Without preparation? They just rehash what they usually say. They don’t cover new ground. They don’t bring new ideas to the table. They just missed a big opportunity to innovate. Not wanting to adapt his presentation. Some speakers are unwilling to move away from what they usually do. Because of the fear of the unknown, the fear of change, or just plain stubbornness. They may not be the best person to speak at your TEDx event. Too passionate to keep an open mind. I have seen several activists who were so passionate about the cause they were defending that they couldn’t conceive others did not necessarily share their views. They spoke passionately about their fight, de facto excluding everyone who didn’t share their point of view, and creating a feeling of aggression in the majority of the public. In collaboration with the presentation directors, the curator of the event has the responsibility to look for these clues, and if necessary axe the speaker from the program. It’s much better to remove one speaker from the show, even if he’s already announced on the program, than take the risk of a disaster on stage.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/26/2019-02-26-5-warning-signs-someone-is-not-ready-for-ted/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","TEDx"],"title":"5 warning signs someone is not ready to speak at your TEDx event"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"If you’re a Startup founder, you’ve heard this all before. “Your elevator pitch should be able to convince anyone in 30 seconds in an elevator”. Hold on hold on hold on! Let’s pause for a few seconds. Imagine that the roles are reversed. You’re in the elevator, lost in your thoughts, minding your own business. There is one other person in it, who you don’t know, and that person is looking intensely at you. You find it weird and you feel a bit uncomfortable. But the worst is yet to come. That person starts talking to you! By the time your brain switches from “where did I put my keys” to “why is he talking to me and what is he talking about?” the doors of the lift open, and you get out of it as fast as possible, not looking back from fear that weirdo could start talking to you again.\nThat scene in Wall Street where a young Charlie Sheen pops out of nowhere and convinces Michael Douglas? It’s fake. Most of what you see in Hollywood movies is fake.\nYou don’t deliver a cold pitch to someone. You start a conversation. Listen to what the other person has to say first.

We saw that the best way to fend them off is to strengthen your vital space anchor. But how can you do that?\nIf your presentation has an objective, a clear message, it is much easier to use it as an anchor. Let’s imagine for example that the key message is that your presentation is about a new software service that offers necessary services to protect your IT systems. But the vultures—who don’t really understand what it’s about—are out to eat the tech guy. They question every choice, every detail, every functionality. The presentation turns into an endless discussion of details. If that happens, re-anchor the presentation. Remind them of the objective, the message: “Yes, we can discuss about whether we can add the animated dog on the configuration page later, but this is secondary. What is really important is that we guarantee that we have the right level of protection, and this is the best tool to do it.”\nBullies also like to behave like spoiled children. They throw themselves on the ground, kicking and screaming (mostly figuratively, I haven’t seen someone actually throw himself on the ground—that would have been interesting—but I heard plenty of people screaming to try to cover the sound of their incompetence). They won’t take no as an answer. You know what? No is exactly the answer they need, with a short sentence explaining the consequences, no more. For example: “No, we cannot add this because this would increase the budget / increase the risk / increase delivery time.” The longer your justification is, the more it becomes self-justification, the weaker it becomes, the more mouth-watering you become to the vultures. Be sure to do this only for unjustified requests, not for legitimate concerns or needs. Instead of being the prey, you become the bully’s super nanny. You’re the adult in the room, anchored, with a good message to defend. When you do that, something funny happens. Most bullies instinctively understand they’re starting to look immature and are going to lose their power, and they calm down by themselves. Only the slower ones don’t get it. Be kind to them.\nThe vultures will also try to destabilize you with questions you don’t have the answer. Although not being able to answer any question means you’re not prepared properly (and in that case that’s your problem, not the bully’s problem), it’s perfectly fine and normal not to have 100% of the answers. Just say it. “I don’t have the answer, we will test it and I will come back to you.” See? That simple. You even behaved proactively by proposing to find the answer to the question.\nThese are only a few examples of the techniques you can use to get out of a presentation slump and gain confidence. Anybody willing to invest the time and effort can change and become a good presenter. This is also what a good coach can do for you. He can help you anchor yourself so Vultures will start starving and look elsewhere. He can help you learn to stay firm in hostile environments. He can help you become the good leader people want to follow.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/12/2019-02-12-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-2/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 2)"},{"author":"","contents":"The secret ingredient in any presentation is Your Audience. Don’t forget to ask these essential questions to be sure you don’t fail before you’ve even started to speak.\nTranscript Phil: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your double espresso of presentation know-how.\nRose: [00:00:05] This episode is all about the magic ingredient in any presentation: Your Audience.\nPhil: [00:00:12] So Rose, when I ask people what they hate most about presentations, one thing that comes up all the time is that they hate it when they\u0026rsquo;re receiving a standard presentation, which just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it is suited to that audience.\nRose: [00:00:27] Exactly, Phil. I often think of it like Christmas. So think of your presentation like a gift. Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at Christmas and you\u0026rsquo;re opening your gift and it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful. You pull off the bow and you look around and at the same time you all pull out\u0026hellip; the same pair of socks. And you realize, \u0026ldquo;Mom, you probably could have done better than all of us having the same pair of socks.\u0026rdquo;\nRose: [00:00:49] Maybe when you\u0026rsquo;re giving gifts you think about what would actually mean something to your grandmother and what would actually mean something to your kids. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not \u0026ldquo;the socks.” So Phil, we have some methodology we use at Ideas on Stage that helps us think about the necessary questions to prepare a presentation for an audience. Can you tell us about that?\nPhil: [00:01:08] Absolutely Rose. So we always start with the ABC. Audience. Burning need. Context. It\u0026rsquo;s the first step. It\u0026rsquo;s so important. And most presenters don\u0026rsquo;t do it. So first off: who is your audience? And you need to get to know your audience beyond simply the title on their business card. Who are they really? I had one chief executive who came to me for example for help with a presentation at a conference and I asked him, \u0026ldquo;So, who\u0026rsquo;s in the audience?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;OK well come back when you do because I can\u0026rsquo;t help you to prepare a successful presentation if we don\u0026rsquo;t know who the audience is.\u0026rdquo; Because the audience is the magic ingredient. So the second part then is the burning need.\nRose: [00:01:53] Oh yes. Your example makes me think. I was working with someone the other day as well and I asked, \u0026ldquo;So, when you\u0026rsquo;re preparing this presentation, what is your team expecting from you in the presentation? Do they need to know numbers? Do they need some moral support? Do they need some reassurance?\u0026rdquo; I looked at him: “[he said] I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo; Same thing. I said, \u0026ldquo;Okay can you find out? Because this is what\u0026rsquo;s going to guide you in preparing an effective presentation.\u0026rdquo; What are their needs from you? Of course, what is your objective? But what are they expecting?\nPhil: [00:02:27] Yes, you\u0026rsquo;ve always got to start from where they are. That\u0026rsquo;s vital. So often when we\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC with a client they will find that they actually ****don\u0026rsquo;t know some of this information, but they know that they need to find it out. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just asking the right questions. So the \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; then is for context. This is all about how long the presentation is supposed to be. Will there be questions and answers afterwards? Is there somebody else presenting before? If so, what are they presenting? Is there someone presenting afterwards? What time of day is it going to be? For example, is it first thing in the morning? Which is good for getting people to really understand things. Is it first thing in the afternoon? In which case, good luck… All of these things: the technology you have available. Do you have a projector? Do you have sound? Lots of different questions that will help you to understand the context. It\u0026rsquo;s also your audience\u0026rsquo;s business context: is their business going well? Is it not going well? Where are they in the financial cycle? In the sales context: do they already have a supplier? Do they already work with you? All of these things you need to know. And you\u0026rsquo;ll find that when you\u0026rsquo;re doing the ABC it\u0026rsquo;s always just asking the simple but really important questions. And it\u0026rsquo;s the five most important minutes that you can ever spend when preparing a presentation.\nRose: [00:03:45] Excellent Phil. When is this presentation going to happen? Who is it with? I completely agree. So remember: this is not your presentation, it\u0026rsquo;s theirs. The magic ingredient in any presentation is: the Audience. Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s the magic ingredient in your presentation.\nPhil: [00:04:06] Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution. We\u0026rsquo;ve got so much more to share.

You didn’t manage to shake off your nerves. You became confused. The client or your boss criticized you. Maybe you’ve been caught in a downward spiral for some time, each criticism making you lose confidence, and making the next presentation worse. I have good news for you: no matter what your situation is, this vicious circle can be broken, and you gain the necessary confidence to enjoy presenting.\nHaters are going to hate Before I explain how, let’s put things into context. Haters are going to hate. Some people have a psychological problem, and are there to put others down. This can be to mask their own insecurities and problems, or it can be because they like to bully others. Unfortunately, those types seem to thrive in certain work environments. Stop feeling guilty right now because of these people. They are the ones who have a problem, not you. If that describes your boss, he’s not behaving like the leader he could be. If that describes your client, he does not behave like the competent client he could be. I’m fine with people giving me blunt, critical but honest feedback, even if it may be hard to hear. But I won’t accept people using criticism and attacks to put others down, and nobody should. I will also give you another secret: these vultures are really not that strong. They build their power on charm, fear and submission. But they are hated by everyone. Their subordinates. Their fellow managers or C-level executives. Even their bosses hate them. At the first opportunity everybody will jump ship and abandon them. Once you start to understand that, they are really not that fearsome anymore.\nI started by addressing this point because, in my experience, this is really the factor that makes people doubt themselves and lose their presentation powers. In a secure environment, you feel alright, but as soon as you see the shadows of the vultures circling above your head, you lose confidence. Vultures? Yes, that’s exactly what they are! They are scavengers, they like to prey on perceived weaknesses and vulnerabilities, but they’re really not that courageous. To starve the vultures, you just need to show you are alive and ready to stand firm. How? By strengthening your anchor in your vital space.\nThe goal of the vultures is to reduce your vital space or push you out of it. The vultures are circling around your vital space, they are always trying to invade it by stealing your energy and confidence. It’s only a facade. If you remain anchored, your vital space will protect you and you will be able to fend off all threats with calm and confidence. It will become a natural part of your presentations. Being able to jump out of your vital space is useful, but don’t do it before you have the confidence to do so and learn to do it without turning into a vulture.\nIn the second part I will explain several techniques to stay anchored and protect your vital space, and scare off the presentation vultures.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/02/05/2019-02-05-how-to-starve-the-presentation-vultures-1/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Fear","Business"],"title":"How to starve the presentation vultures (part 1)"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"A few weeks ago, Ideas on Stage had the privilege of organizing a sales presentation training for Krauthammer at Dolce La Hulpe, close to Brussels in Belgium. For us, delivering a training for dozens of senior people at Krauthammer, one of the world’s most respected sales and management training companies, felt like designing something for Jonathan Ive, Apple’s legendary designer: a bit intimidating but incredibly exciting.\nThe training met with great success, and it was fantastic to work with such talented people, but what I will remember most are two presentations. During the hands-on course, groups prepared a sales pitch, and at the end of the day, each group had to deliver its presentation in front of the others.\nThe first group was stunning! The beginning of the presentation used the music from “Also sprach Zarathustra” from Richard Strauss, the piece you hear in the movie 2001, A Space Odyssey when mankind discovers the use of tools. Not speaking at all, just pointing to a few words at a time on the slides to deliver his key message. He had his audience’s attention fully captured!\nBoy, was the second group in trouble. How can you beat such a brilliant presentation? Well, the second presenter calmly and confidently went on stage. And started singing the tune of “Also sprach Zarathustra” live! Everybody, impressed by his boldness and his clever and humorous improvisation, feeling fully connected and present, started singing along. Using great body language to increase the dramatic effect, he stole the show. After doing this he simply said “This is how we do it at Krauthammer. We don’t do playback, we always do it live!” Everybody laughed and had a great time. This is exactly the kind of presentation they will still remember and talk about next year, whereas countless other boring presentations will have been long forgotten.\nThey probably won’t do that in front of a real client. But they will remember the need to be memorable. By default, your audience will forget everything you say—fast. It’s up to you to find a way to make your messages stick. (With or without singing.)\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/29/2019-01-29-how-to-steal-the-show/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Training","Krauthammer","Presentations","Business"],"title":"How to steal the show"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"I know, paraphrasing the motto of the great Muhammad Ali, “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”, doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yet my point is that in a debate it is extremely important to listen and move with a maximum of agility, and talk with a maximum of punch.\nTake the example of the Gilets jaunes controversy in France. The government was completely taken by surprise by the popularity of the movement. Their initial listening position lacked agility and guile. They were perceived as static, which gave the impression, justified or not, that they were not listening at all. Their counters used words that didn’t have any punch, believing that the threat would disappear by itself.\nOnly after receiving glancing blows to the head did they start to realize how serious their situation was, and how much their strength had already been sapped. The president tried to counter. He had good arguments and gave away a lot, but only got more attacks in return. Why? Because he used his arguments inefficiently. Instead of using them in a way that would have made the movement pause and doubt, he threw away his best shots, he gave the impression he was losing, and that gave more confidence and energy to his opponents.\nWhen under attack, if you counter weakly, it only strengthens your opponent and saps your morale. Start by floating (listening) like a butterfly, put yourself in a favorable position, then sting (speak) like a bee when the time is right.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/22/2019-01-22-listen-like-a-butterfly-talk-like-a-bee/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Debate","Muhammad Ali","Tips"],"title":"Listen like a butterfly, talk like a bee"},{"author":"","contents":"Rose asks Phil how to overcome your fear before a big presentation, and turn it into positive energy on stage.

Phil, is everything okay?\nPhil: I\u0026rsquo;m just really feeling kind of nervous. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m properly prepared for today.\nRose: Well you\u0026rsquo;re in luck because today\u0026rsquo;s episode is all about calming presentation nerves. We all get them. (Phil, we\u0026rsquo;re recording.) So right before we were talking about how to calm presentation nerves. Before we get into some solutions, let\u0026rsquo;s take a stage fright diagnostic. Phil, can I ask you a few questions about how you feel? Is your heart racing? How\u0026rsquo;s your voice? Can you try saying something?\nPhil: It\u0026rsquo;s kind of dry and hard to get it out.\nRose: OK. Are you able to focus? Can you look straight ahead for a moment? Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to keep direct eye contact.\nPhil: I \u0026rsquo;m just too stressed.\nRose: O K, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can find where the issue arose. So, thinking about preparing for your \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; today: did you prepare in a four-part process and think about the ideas and creating the presentation?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you rehearse? Did you try to practice a few times, maybe even five or six times?\nPhil: No.\nRose: Okay, did you get some sleep last night? Maybe six hours or more?\nPhil: No.\nRose: All right. And\u0026hellip; did you have coffee?\nPhil: Yes. (-Two.)\nRose: Yeah, I know you Phil. OK. So here are a few common traps and things that will absolutely activate your nerves. Do you want to talk a little bit more about that Phil?\nPhil: Well absolutely because to be honest stage fright happens to everybody. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t get stage fright you do get nerves. Now I speak in public all the time but I do get nervous before a major presentation. We all do. It was Mark Twain who said, “the world only has two categories of speakers: the nervous and the liars.” So we all get it, right? The question is, how do we make sure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t paralyze us and how do we actually channel that nervous energy and give that energy to our audience rather than letting it paralyze us like it did me a few moments ago.\nRose: Absolutely. And that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of where our work comes in as coaches. We work with people all the time to help them relax and get centered, but also just to learn how to prepare well. There is one other thing we didn\u0026rsquo;t touch on and this is sort of a back-pocket, secret weapon towards nerves and that is: the energy or feeling that\u0026rsquo;s running through your body coming out as trembles sometimes, this is fear. But on the other side of fear is excitement. So connecting to your purpose and what is actually exciting you about presenting, this can really help energize you in a positive way. And remember, this isn\u0026rsquo;t your presentation. This is theirs. So get out of yourself. Come back to the preparation. Avoid the coffee if you can. Get some good night\u0026rsquo;s sleep and prepare.\nPhil: Absolutely. Always focus not on what could go wrong but think about what could go right. Imagine your audience enjoying your presentation, getting your key messages and then achieving your objectives because it\u0026rsquo;s up to them to achieve your objectives for you. So imagine all of that happening. Visualize that happening and it helps a lot. But, you know what I find? It’s that rehearsing your presentation, knowing that that presentation is well-prepared and is going to hit the target with that audience is actually more than half the battle. The rest of it is making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not putting your body in a stressful situation by having coffee, which is wonderful if you want to be productive and creative, but it\u0026rsquo;s not great when you\u0026rsquo;re speaking because not only does it make you speak a lot faster, which actually reduces your credibility, it also dries out your throat and it increases your stress levels. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be doing that when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting.\nRose: So, three things to remember: one, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. Everybody gets presentation nerves, even Phil. Two, prepare and rehearse. Three, take care of your body and your body will take care of you.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nYou’re not alone: we all get nerves. Prepare and rehearse to turn fear into excitement. Take care of your body: avoid coffee, get good sleep, and breathe. Phil: Thanks for joining The Business Presentation Revolution!

Whatever works for you.\n\u0026mdash; Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) January 8, 2019 This tweet says:\n\u0026ldquo;Dear almost everyone on stage at CES: Pay ungodly amounts of money — anything you have to — to get WWDC speaker training ASAP.\nOr go to Juilliard or the Royal Shakespeare Company for a month. Whatever works for you.\u0026rdquo;\nIf you look at the comments in the thread, it seems other attendees agree with him. The average level of the talks was perceived as unprepared and boring. That\u0026rsquo;s the bad news. The good news is, if you prepare well, you have a good chance to stand out and get noticed. And we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about a small event: we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the CES, one of the biggest shows on the planet.\nWe trained people to speak at CES before, including people who felt they were great and didn\u0026rsquo;t need training. It often shocked them when we told them they were not ready, especially people nobody dared to criticize.\nWe often wonder why people invest so little time in what might be the most important thing after actually having a (good) product: their pitch or presentation. There\u0026rsquo;s no miracle. That guy who was a great showman and seemed so natural? He rehearsed – a lot. He took the time to write a great speech and illustrate it with great visuals. He took the time to rehearse, and was coached by professionals.\nYou may think you\u0026rsquo;re just going to wing it. But that won\u0026rsquo;t fly. If you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready, do this test. Ask the best presenter you know to give you honest, unfiltered feedback on your presentation. If you hesitate to do so, maybe you should ask yourself why.\nAs a post-script, if you are organizing an important event, don’t leave anything to chance. Hire a specialist team of presentation coaches, and make sure every speaker gets help with story, slides and speaking. Some speakers may need less help than others - that’s fine. But a speaker who doesn’t have the time to prepare with a coach isn’t going to prepare properly anyway, and a speaker who feels he is too important to be helped will probably be so full of himself that he won’t adapt to your audience. Neither of these speakers has any place on your stage.\nMake sure your speakers shine – otherwise, the only things people will remember from your event are tweets like Rene’s.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/15/2019-01-14-i-presented-at-ces-and-all-i-got-was-a-bunch-of-ungrateful-tweets/","summary":"","tags":["Presentations","Public Speaking","CES","Coaching"],"title":"I presented at CES and all I got was a bunch of ungrateful tweets"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"By now, you’ve probably heard that Apple was doomed. Last Wednesday they released a profit warning press release, followed by an interview with CEO Tim Cook.\nI’m all too aware of Apple’s previous profit warning. Back in the nineties, after Steve Jobs returned to Apple and a Saudi prince (whose name I forget) bought a lot of Apple shares, I decided that I would be a smart investor and I bought Apple shares too.\nThe ride went well, at least until the implosion of the internet bubble, then things got bumpy. But in 2002, after many quarters of growth, the failure of the Cube and the Mac market failing to gain more traction, Steve Jobs delivered the bad news: a profit warning that sent the price of the stock tumbling. Fed up, I sold my shares. Smart investor, my ass. If I had kept those shares, they would have been worth half a million dollars today.\nBut for us presenters, what is really interesting is the contrast between the communication styles of the two profit warnings. First, Tim Cook’s letter is more than 1300 words. In comparison, Steve’s was fewer than 200 words. It’s much easier to get the key message from 200 words than 1300. Shorter communications are much more effective. In fact, I read Steve’s profit warning very quickly, whereas I had to force myself to read through the entirety of Tim’s letter.\nWhy does this matter? It’s especially important because in such a communication, whether written or delivered during a presentation, the information you want people to pay attention to should be at the end. It follows this structure:\nAcknowledge the elephant in the room. We’re going to miss our financial guidance numbers. It doesn’t have to be long. Just tell them how much, and why. Don’t try to mess around finding pathetic excuses: that just adds more fuel to the rumor fire. Give context. Is it really just an Apple problem? No. The slowdown is affecting all players in the industry. Go in for the kill. Out of all players, Apple is the one that remains by far the most profitable, and looking ahead is in the best position to face the future. The third point is really the key message, the one you want everybody to remember. If your delivery is too long, a lot of people will only remember the first point. That you are doomed.\nIf you have to deliver bad news in a presentation, this is how you should do it. Be as succinct as possible. Start with the bad news, provide context, then conclude with the key positive message.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2019/01/08/2019-01-07-what-presentation-lessons-can-we-learn-from-apples-profit-warning/","summary":"","tags":["Apple","Profit Warning","Press Release","Presentations"],"title":"What presentation lessons can we learn from Apple’s profit warning?"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Too many presentations aim only to inform, yet this is one thing oral presentations are particularly bad at \u0026ndash; we forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds.\nIf you want people to remember information, give them a document and a coffee, and time to read. Then you can answer their questions, discuss, agree on the next steps, and leave.\nThis is what happens in meetings at companies like Amazon and LinkedIn, where not only do meetings never have slides - they never have presentations. Meetings begin with a period of silence, during which participants read a document that tells them everything they need to know, and the subjects up for discussion in the meeting.\nAfter reading, everybody is literally on the same page. They ask questions, they check understanding, they discuss, they agree - and nobody gets up to present. Meetings take half as long as they did before. And anyone who missed the meeting can easily read the document to get a far better briefing than they would have got by reading a bunch of bullet points.\nPresentations are very bad at informing people - but they can be great at transforming them.\nWhat is your transformational objective?\nYour aim as a presenter is to change your audience in some way. If, after your presentation, they neither believe, feel, nor do anything new or different, then you’ve wasted your time.\nWhat’s worse is that you’ve wasted theirs.\nTo work out a transformational objective, simply complete this sentence:\nAfter this presentation, my audience will _______________________.\nMake sure the verb in the last part of the sentence is a feeling or doing verb. If you find yourself with the verb “know”, ask yourself why they need to know this – and then complete the sentence again with the real objective.\nBad: “After my presentation, my audience will know our corporate presentation style.”\nGood: “After my presentation, my audience will successfully use our corporate presentation style every time.”\nRemember, if you haven’t got a clear objective, you’re certain not to achieve it.\n--For more tips on how to present successfully follow us on LinkedIn and leave a comment or question!

Learn the golden simple question to ask yourself to make your presentation a success. Guest: Phil Waknell\nTranscript Rose: [00:00:00] Welcome to The Business Presentation Revolution, your regular cup of presentation inspiration.\nPhil: [00:00:07] Today we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at why presentation should rhyme not with Information but with Transformation.\nRose: [00:00:16] So Phil, you said that presentations should rhyme with transformation instead of information. What do you mean by that?\nPhil: [00:00:23] Well, far too many presentations simply aim to inform the audience, to transfer neurons, brain cells, from the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain to the audience\u0026rsquo;s brain. And you know what? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because we don\u0026rsquo;t have perfect memories. Do you have a perfect memory?\nRose: [00:00:40] Unfortunately no.\nPhil: [00:00:41] We forget most of what we hear within 30 seconds, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that try and remember what I said 30 seconds ago. That\u0026rsquo;s really really hard. So if you aim only to inform the audience then you\u0026rsquo;ll fail. If you want to give them information then give them a document, give them a coffee and give them some time so they can read that document. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective but a presentation is fantastic for transforming the audience.\nPhil: [00:01:07] It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic for changing something in what the audience believes, in what they feel and in what they do. So always ask yourself this question when you\u0026rsquo;re presenting: \u0026ldquo;After this presentation the audience will ____.\u0026rdquo; What? What will they believe differently, what will they feel differently, what will they do differently. And that\u0026rsquo;s your objective.\nRose: [00:01:33] I completely agree Phil and what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is that unfortunately I think we\u0026rsquo;ve all been trained pretty wrong, even in our schools, when we grow up we\u0026rsquo;re taught to give information first, to value the information. But what I\u0026rsquo;m hearing is we don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to do that and it\u0026rsquo;s not the most effective place: in a boardroom, in a presentation. And what we can do instead is focus on making a change in what they know, what they believe, what they feel and what they\u0026rsquo;re going to do after the presentation. Is that right?\nPhil: [00:02:07] That\u0026rsquo;s absolutely right. I think the real key point is that the main subject of your presentation is not the information you have to tell them\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s the audience. It\u0026rsquo;s all about them and it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you need to transform them in order to achieve your objectives.\nPhil: [00:02:24] You may need to put some information into that presentation of course, in order to achieve those objectives, but it\u0026rsquo;s all about the transformation. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve got information that does not support your transformational objective then take it out because what you take out will actually reinforce what you leave in.\nRose: [00:02:43] So this reminds me, yesterday when I was coaching this young executive at one of the larger French companies we work with, he is working on his communication style. And when you\u0026rsquo;re communicating to an executive team you know very well you need to be brief. You need to say what needs to be said directly. Well another thing we talked about is in his presentation he will only have 20 minutes to actually motivate his team to take action on a project. This is not the time to inform them of all the bullet points that go into \u0026lsquo;why the project\u0026rsquo;, the action plan, etc. This is the time to motivate them, reassure them, make them feel confident and supported. And I saw the light bulb go on for him yesterday. And I think it can for all of us when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about how we design a presentation.\nPhil: [00:03:33] Absolutely. So always remember if your only aim is information, well cancel your presentation and give them a document and a coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective. But if you actually have an aim of transforming your audience, motivating them like with your client there or making them want to buy something or making them desire something or just making them believe something different: well, that\u0026rsquo;s your objective. Build everything around that.\nPhil: [00:03:58] And remember that what you tell them they\u0026rsquo;ll probably forget, but what they feel and what they get out of it in terms of transformation: that will last. And that\u0026rsquo;s what makes an effective presentation.\nRose: [00:04:15] Phil, now that would be a real revolution. Thank you for watching. We hope we have transformed how you think of presentations.\n[00:04:23] And we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot more to share. So, please subscribe to our YouTube channel or wherever you get your podcasts.

Guest: Phil Waknell","permalink":"/revolution/episode-00001/","summary":"","tags":"","title":"Transformation"},{"author":"Phil Waknell","contents":"Yesterday French President Emmanuel Macron took live, unscripted questions from an audience of 2000 tech entrepreneurs and investors at Station F, the undisputed hub of the French startup community. Ideas on Stage may not be a tech company, but we have helped thousands of start-ups with their pitches, and partner with many accelerators including Ashoka’s ShareIT.io, based at Station F. So we are very much part of the French Tech ecosystem, and very interested in how it is evolving under its new Director, our good friend Kat Borlongan. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t present for the event at Station F, you can catch the playback on Facebook LIVE here.\nIt’s no surprise to see Macron supporting tech entrepreneurs: while Economy Minister a few years back, he was regularly seen at tech events and even CES. But taking live questions, on a day when his government was under fire about the time it is taking over the cabinet reshuffle, was brave to say the least.\nMost politicians would have ensured questions were ‘planted’ in the audience, or simply gathered questions beforehand and addressed them in turn. Macron did neither. Questions were taken from a sea of raised hands by Kat Borlongan, not by Macron, and I know first-hand that those questions were chosen at random.\nI’m not going to comment on the politics or the quality of his answers. (I always try to stay out of politics.) But I will cover three important points that speakers can learn from what Macron did very well, and two more from what he could still improve.\n1. Improvisation requires preparation\nIf Macron was able to listen to unprepared questions and seem completely at ease responding to them – on subjects as varied as diversity, anti-trust, ed-tech, visas and even pesticides – it is because he was extremely well-briefed.\nBirds can ‘wing it’. Presenters cannot. Macron knew when taking this stage that he would have to deal with a wide variety of subjects, and at no stage did he seem lost or short of an answer, plus he did not dodge any question as politicians tend to do. Whether you agree with his policies or not, he is certainly very well-informed.\nImprovisation is hard for anyone (and impossible for some). There is a danger that presenters think that their choice is either to prepare very well, or to improvise and therefore not need to prepare. That is wrong. Macron gave a fine example of how strong preparation makes you ready to improvise.\nPreparation is always the difference between weak and strong communication. Whether you are learning a speech or preparing a Q\u0026amp;A session, Benjamin Franklin’s famous words always apply: “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”\n2. Dare to surprise\nOne question received its own round of applause, because it resonated with so many entrepreneurs in the audience. The questioner explained that he finds it difficult to recruit employees because of the very high employers’ social charges, which mean in France that an employee costs far more than they actually take home. “My enemy is the URSSAF,” (the French Social Security agency).\nMacron took a moment to reflect on this statement and the audience’s sympathetic applause, and replied: “The URSSAF is your friend.”\nIt would have been very easy to sympathize, and then to explain what his government is doing to reduce social security charges and government spending, but Macron chose a daring approach. He chose to say the opposite of what most entrepreneurs in the room believed. Immediately the audience had a tweetable, newsworthy statement, and he had everybody’s attention.\nHe then went on to defend the French social model, and the importance of social security, while later saying that they are working to lower social charges and make hiring easier. But that would not have been as powerful without his daring, controversial statement that everybody will easily remember days and weeks later.\nDare to surprise your audience. They will sit up and pay attention – and that is half the battle for any speaker.\n3. Smile, and the audience smiles with you\nOne improvement I have noticed in Macron’s speaking behavior over the years has been his smile. While his predecessor François Hollande strove in vain to appear presidential, and therefore always tried to seem serious and grave, Macron appears to believe in his ideas and policies, and he is now visibly positive when he explains them.\nSmiling is important for two reasons. First, when we smile, the audience can hear it. Our words sound more positive, more engaging, and less boring. Try this on the phone, or try to listen on your next call. You can tell whether your correspondent is smiling.\nThe second reason is that we all have mirror neurons which unconsciously perceive and reproduce the emotions we perceive in others. If you see a speaker who appears negative, demotivated, or even bored, then you will experience the same feelings. If however you see a speaker who is positive, who speaks with passion, who clearly believes what she is saying, then you will feel the same way.\nMacron appeared to enjoy the exchange yesterday. He seemed positive in explaining his policies. That made it so much easier for the audience to feel equally positive.\nSo those are three important lessons any speaker can learn from President Macron’s exchange yesterday. Here are two more speaking tips, which Macron can still improve on, and which we can all benefit from employing more.\n4. Short answers are best\nIn a session where there are potentially hundreds of questions, answering only a handful of them will leave many people disappointed, and many subjects uncovered. This may be easier for the speaker, but it is not better for the audience. While Macron’s initial speech was refreshingly short, his answers to most of the questions were very long. Although he tried to make it up by staying longer than planned and taking four questions at the end when Kat had said there was time for only one, it would have been a far more dynamic, interesting and fruitful exchange if he had taken twice as many questions, and answered each one in half the time.\nWhy? The danger when you give a long answer is that people forget the question, or they forget the beginning of your answer when you get to the end. It is also usually true that much of the audience has no interest in the answer to some questions, therefore it is wise not to take too long unless the answer is of clear interest to everybody. For example, the first question yesterday was about EdTech which is an important niche but a niche nonetheless, and after several minutes, anyone not in that niche was left wondering when Macron would finish and move on to a subject they might care about.\nAim to keep any answer to no more than two minutes. When you set yourself this limit, you will be amazed at what you can say in those two minutes, and it will be more powerful than a comprehensive 5-minute answer.\n5. Finish with a flourish\nMany speakers fail to pay attention to the end of their speech, or the end of their sentences. Yesterday, Macron was able to speak clearly and coherently for minutes on end, but then once he would start to wrap-up his answers, he appeared to run out of words, or out of breath, and tail off. Twice the audience though he had finished, and applauded when in fact he had not properly completed his sentence. On several other occasions, it was clear he was already thinking of the next sentence, and lost power at the end of the current sentence in his haste to begin the next. This is one of the most common problems I encounter when helping speakers.\nSadly this lackluster finish also happened right at the very end of the evening when Macron gave a call to action to the entrepreneurs in the room. This was an excellent way to finish, but unfortunately the last sentence tailed off, and ended up with slightly awkward applause punctuated by a slightly embarrassed “Voilà” from the President.\nThink of a sentence like a two-headed match. It should begin powerfully, like striking the head of a match causing it to burst into flame. Then, keep your message burning, ensuring nobody switches off. And finally, at the end, when a typical match or dull statement would normally sizzle out into silence, suddenly and surprisingly, it reignites in flame!\n(This analogy also goes for any presentation. Start strong, and finish with a flourish.)\nMacron could benefit from practicing conclusions. And any speaker can gain power and credibility by ensuring they finish each sentence – especially the final one – clearly and powerfully. Even when improvising. And if you have prepared well, you will likely have already generated several possible conclusions you can use that will ensure a big round of applause.\nPresident Macron is a powerful, confident communicator. And even though he is already a highly skilled speaker, he is not yet the finished article, and he continues to improve. That in itself should be a lesson to us all: every speaker, no matter how good, has potential to further develop and stretch their skills. It comes through practice, a desire to improve, and through a deep respect for your audience that drives you to give them the best experience possible.\nMacron gave French Tech a great experience yesterday. I have no doubt he’ll be even better next time.\nPhotos © Ideas on Stage 2018\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/10/10/2018-10-10-5-speaking-lessons-from-president-macron/","summary":"","tags":["Public Speaking","Lessons","President","French","Macron","Talk","Technique","Tips","Learning","Presenting","Tech","Station F","Paris","Politics",""],"title":"5 Speaking Lessons from President Macron"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s already October and you know what that means\u0026hellip; Firming up plans for next year. Pitching projects. Assigning budgets. And ultimately getting creative about how to expire old, ineffective systems and implement a smarter and better approach. Look around and catch the shift. It\u0026rsquo;s not time for just another step forward. It\u0026rsquo;s time to leap.\nAt Ideas on Stage we coach, train and design for international clients and companies large and small, from CAC 40 enterprises to startups and incubators. They invite us in to provide outside perspective and help leadership and teams to think big, bold and with purpose for how to serve their respective end user, whether internal or external.\nRecently, as our team was reflecting on the past 12-months, and wondering what we wanted to develop in the year to come, we got inspired to assemble a fun 1min video-montage highlighting some of the speeches and stages we helped to animate between fall 2017-2018. For a quick sip of energy, you can find the video at the end of this post.\nWhile working with people from such a wide range of industries, we hear a universal theme arise: How do we transform the inside of our organization into something meaningful, powerful and relevant in our changing economic landscape?\nThere are countless examples of these evolutions:\nFinancial institutions are becoming more agile and customer centric. Corporates are partnering with startups to build innovative solutions. Hospitality is shifting to meet new demands in a sharing economy. The list goes on\u0026hellip; At Ideas on Stage we love bringing work and pleasure together to inspire creative thinking and optimize the power of collaboration. Things work better that way. More gets done. Just don\u0026rsquo;t forget the dark chocolate.\nSo, as autumn leaves fall carrying their message of change, let\u0026rsquo;s imagine where this leap might take us. A few questions to get you started:\n_what would you want to achieve next year if you knew you could not fail? _ how do you want your team, company or personal presence to grow? how would you like to feel the next time you speak? how do you currently prepare for important events or presentations? how will you use your voice more effectively for the benefit of all? Spark any ideas? Jot them down. Once you have a little insight into what you want to be, say and do in 2019\u0026ndash;and beyond\u0026ndash;ask yourself: are you ready?\nNo matter the answer.

Participants in Vancouver will be treated to high-quality talks from well-prepared speakers, and will leave feeling energized and inspired.\nBack in the office, you and your colleagues will no doubt be subjected to low-quality presentations from poorly-prepared speakers, and you will leave feeling bored and uninspired.\nBusiness presentations are not TED talks. A board meeting is not a stage with a round red carpet. Yet businesses can and should learn a few vital lessons from TED, and apply them to their own presentations.\nWhat makes TED talks different from most business presentations? Let\u0026rsquo;s focus on three key factors.\n**1. Short talks are better **\nOne of the key rules at TED is that no presentation can last more than 18 minutes, no matter who is speaking. Businesses should take note. We always used to ask ourselves the question: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation long enough to tell them everything I want to say?\u0026rdquo;\nIn fact a better question would be: \u0026ldquo;Is my presentation short enough to keep their attention and ensure they remember my key messages?\u0026rdquo;\nAttention spans are short, and in an oral presentation people forget most of what they hear within 30 seconds, so the more you say, the less they remember of it. Better to say little, but to say it effectively. Remember the words of Baltasar Gracián: \u0026ldquo;Good things, when short, are twice as good.\u0026rdquo;\n**2. Slides are visual aids, not cheat-sheets or handouts **\nMany TED talks do not use any slides. They are not always necessary, and many business presentations do not need them either. Frankly, any business presentation would be more effective with no slides than with bad, text-heavy slides that actually stop the audience from listening to the speaker. People simply cannot read and listen at the same time, so the more text you put on your slide, the less you are communicating.\nTED speakers do not use slides as their cheat-sheets: slides, where they are used, are visual aids to help the audience to understand and remember their key messages. Business presenters should use them in the same way. If you need a cheat-sheet or notes to remember the flow of your presentation, that\u0026rsquo;s fine: keep it on a card or piece of paper in front of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t project it behind you. If you need to distribute information so your audience has a record of what you said, give them a short standalone document that summarizes your key messages, but don\u0026rsquo;t imagine that your slides will do that job. If they are good visual aids, they will not be a good handout.\nUse slides only where needed, and make sure they follow the 5-second rule: every time you click, the audience should be able to \u0026lsquo;get\u0026rsquo; the new content in under 5 seconds. Otherwise they will stop listening to you, and the communication will be broken.\n**3. Preparation is the key to success **\nEvery TED speaker prepares their talk over a period of several months, with the help of professional presentation coaches. At Ideas on Stage, we\u0026rsquo;ve helped many hundreds of TED and TEDx speakers to imagine and create a fascinating talk, to illustrate it with breathtaking visual aids, and to prepare mentally and physically to take the stage and speak convincingly to their audience. Preparation is the key to success.\nFor most business presentations, you won\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of spending months fine-tuning your talk with specialist help. You have limited time and need to spend it wisely. But you can still prepare well, and your audience deserves a well-prepared presentation.\nIf your time is limited, don\u0026rsquo;t waste it all producing slides. Slides are always optional, sometimes nice-to-have, but never necessary - especially if you are anyway giving your audience a short hand-out. Rehearsal, however, is required. If your presentation lasts 18 minutes - and ideally it should not be much longer - then it only takes an hour to rehearse it three times. The fourth time will be far more convincing than the first.\nSo if you have limited time, skip the slides but take an hour to rehearse. It will be time well-spent and your presentation will be far more powerful as a result.\nSummary\nBusiness can learn many lessons from the success of TED, starting with these three:\nShort talks are better: don\u0026rsquo;t say too much, but say it effectively Slides are visual aids: don\u0026rsquo;t use them as cheat-sheets or handouts Preparation is the key to success: take the time to prepare and rehearse There are many more: for example, your introduction should create an emotional reaction that makes the audience want to listen; and we remember information far better when it\u0026rsquo;s told in the form of a story or example. Those rules are just as applicable in business.\nIf you apply these lessons to your next business presentation, the result might not look like a TED talk, but it will have a much better chance of energizing and inspiring its participants than a poorly-prepared speaker muddling through a bunch of boring bullet-points.\nYour audiences deserve successful presentations, and your business depends on them.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to learn more about TEDifying your business presentations, contact us at info@ideasonstage.com or fill in the form below and we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to you quickly.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/04/10/2018-04-10-what-business-can-learn-from-ted/","summary":"","tags":["TED","TEDx","Business Presentation","Tips","Presentations","Business"],"title":"What Business Can Learn From TED"},{"author":"Michael Rickwood","contents":" Fear doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove the danger. Embrace it and get on top of your presentations.\n\u0026ldquo;There is nothing to fear but fear itself\u0026rdquo; - a memorable line from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u0026rsquo;s inaugural address in 1932 at the depths of the Great Depression. At the time he may not have realized it, but his words are among the most powerful pieces of advice for public speaking.\nAfter all, what we all fear in presentations is succumbing to fear. Losing our cool, forgetting what needs to be said, not convincing the audience enough. Failing in front of our peers. Doubt, doubt and more doubt.\nBut fear is often generated and worsened by inaction. How many of us do not act when faced by our fears? Fear is a mechanism of the mind to forewarn us, an alarm that lets us know that danger lies ahead and we should do something about it before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nThe science behind fear is well-documented. Many of us have heard of the \u0026ldquo;fight or flight\u0026rdquo; instinct. For a speaker, these two extreme actions are manifested by the loss of presence from either shrinking and hiding from an audience (\u0026ldquo;flight\u0026rdquo;) or coming out swinging or trying to control them (\u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo;). The third extreme reaction is to \u0026ldquo;freeze\u0026rdquo; - the presentation equivalent of \u0026ldquo;playing dead\u0026rdquo;.\nThe natural balance where you can make a true connection with an audience comes from confidence and relaxation. Some of us are better equipped to deal with fear, while some of us are not stable enough to manage it well. We can all benefit, though, from reducing unnecessary sources of fear that cause stress we can do without.\nThe following 7 steps may not be a cure for everyone, particularly those with deep fears linked to public speaking, but they are a very good start.\n1. Master your content - don\u0026rsquo;t let it master you.\nThere are often parts of a presentation where the speaker does not entirely master what he or she is talking about. These knowledge gaps can be stressful, and trying to explain something that you have not fully mastered will bring a negative feedback loop from the audience as they struggle to understand. Present only what you master, and master everything you present.\n2. Rehearse aloud in advance with your slides and timer.\nRehearsing aloud is the best thing any speaker can do, but also the rarest. We can spend hours tweaking messages or putting polish on slides, but never enough time on our feet rehearsing. Use a timer so you know exactly how long your presentation takes, and ensure you only take 90% of your allotted time so that on the day you are not stressed about overrunning.\n3. Connect with your audience.\nIf you can meet members of the audience prior to a presentation, this can be hugely beneficial. You must not think like an actor waiting in the wings until the curtain rises. This makes the task harder. Knowing at least some of your audience, and knowing they are not dragons, will reduce your fear and stress.\n4. Check that everything works.\nTechnical problems can disrupt a presentation, but even if it all ends up running smoothly, the fear of technical problems can be very destabilizing for a presenter. Many presentations have sunk due to last minute problems with slides, compatibility issues (software and hardware), fonts not downloaded, resolution issues, not having the right adaptor, etc. Solution? Get there early and take the time to ensure all slides and videos look good in real conditions - on the actual computer and actual screen - and you will save yourself a lot of worry, and reduce your stress levels. You should also find the technician in charge of the room. They are your best friend. I once had a technician who saved me from a crashed and locked computer during a presentation in front of a dozen Chinese fashion executives.\n5. Trust yourself.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t rehearse your presentation 101 times. Trust your subconscious mind and leave a little margin for the unknown. You\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy it more.\n6. Avoid coffee.\nThis should be obvious but many speakers don\u0026rsquo;t realize how important it is. Don\u0026rsquo;t drink coffee before presenting, especially if you know you are sensitive to it. Caffeine not only increases your stress levels: it also dries out your mouth and throat, so your voice is less resonant and less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ve trained coffee companies and they know this - so should you!\n7. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of being afraid.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m back to the original quotation. If you accept that everyone feels fear when they take the stage, even the greatest speakers, then you can also accept that stress is the body\u0026rsquo;s way of preparing you to perform at your best.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t completely eliminate all stress when presenting, and you would perform worse if you did. These tips will help you to remove unnecessary stress, leaving you with just enough so you can master it, and use it to deliver your best.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/04/09/2018-04-10-7-tips-for-overcoming-the-fear-of-presenting/","summary":"","tags":["Stage fright","Presenting","Fear","Public Speaking"],"title":"7 Tips for Overcoming the Fear of Presenting"},{"author":"Marion Chapsal","contents":"Have you seen Gary Oldman in his interpretation of Churchill in the latest biopic by Joe Wright? If you have not, please go. It’s jaw-dropping. His outstanding performance may very soon win him an Oscar. You will enjoy some of the finest acting and also benefit from precious presentation lessons from the Master Orator.\nHere are 3 takeaways from the movie, which you can immediately apply for your next keynote, sales meeting or investor pitch.\n1.\tSit down and listen. © Working Title Films—@Working_Title\nIn one scene, likely fictional according to the critics, Churchill decides to go and meet the people.\nHe takes his first-ever ride on a London Underground train, and begins asking random citizens if they would fight the Nazis even if the odds were stacked against them? They reply in one clear, loud and vibrant voice: “Never surrender!”\nThere and then, Churchill’s decision to refuse peace talks with Hitler is strengthened. He rushes to deliver what will become one of his most powerful speeches, taking into account these citizens’ words, quoting them and even crediting them by name.\nI loved this scene and frankly do not care whether it happened or not. In fact, it resembles the coaching advice I recently gave to the Senior Manager of an international company during one of our first sessions. As we explored the context of his annual strategy presentation, using Ideas on Stage methodologies like the ABCs (Audience, Burning Needs, Context), I gently guided him through a series of discovery questions. He soon realized he had only the vaguest sense of his audience: what was their experience? What did they most want and need from him in his speech?\n“Why don’t you learn directly from your people?” I offered. Ask them. Wait. Listen quietly. Put yourself in their shoes. Thank them. And then reflect back.\nSo, during the Christmas holidays, he collected feedback and stories from his teams across Europe. In his talk, delivered before several hundred sales managers, he incorporated several personal stories that made the difference. “Wendy from the UK told me…, Karl from Germany…, etc.” He truly connected with his audience and showed them he cared.\n\u0026ldquo;Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”—Winston Churchill\n2.\tPrepare to sweat. Maybe not blood and tears, but certainly sweat. In this movie, we see once again how Churchill literally perspires over the writing of his speeches. Even to the point of “steaming”. Just like Steve Jobs, Churchill was not a “born speaker”. And we believe no-one is.\nHe drafted his speeches many times over, until the very last moment. He dictated them to a secretary. Perhaps today he would use his iPhone to record himself and save some poor girl’s nerves. He then rehearsed passages, again and again, pacing up and down his room, repeating them aloud, learning whole speeches by heart.\nAs we coach CEOs, start-up entrepreneurs, doctors and TEDx speakers, we are often asked: “How long will the preparation last? How many sessions will it take?” The answer: it all depends on how dedicated you are to the task and its success. How much are you willing to invest in your success? It takes true dedication and involves many hours of lonely drafting, stumbling over words, pausing and rewriting. And then again, iterations with visuals. And rehearsals. Out loud. Again and again.\nIt’s a performance. It involves your whole brain, your whole body. Your full presence. That’s why leaders seek out seasoned presentation coaches for this delicate mental, emotional and physical preparation.\n3.\tEmbrace imperfection and fear. Churchill wasn’t born a master orator—he overcame a childhood lisp by painstakingly practicing enunciation. He also always took his notes with him and would sometimes appear to stumble or hesitate, all in order to make a calculated effect.\nHe knew that a speech which is too perfect, with almost robotic delivery, would put people to sleep. He knew that the more conversational and simple a speech sounded, the more tuned in his audience would be. There is a very touching scene when King George VI asks Churchill if he is afraid. “I am most terribly. Terribly afraid,” admits Churchill.\nDuring our coaching sessions and workshops, we pay attention to vulnerability. We don’t aim at perfection; we aim rather to bring out your authentic best. In the intimate space of trust and acceptance created between the coach and the speaker, fear is invited, politely. And then just as politely, we make sure she keeps quiet. This way we free up the space to hear the voice of passion, care, enthusiasm.\nSpeaking in public doesn’t require you to be fearless. It requires you to speak through the fear.\nCall to Action: Next time you find yourself getting prepared to give a presentation, remember these 3 simple tips from The Darkest Hour and prepare to give your finest talk yet:\n− Be brave enough to listen to your audience—and if you have no idea what they are thinking, feeling, believing or doing, find out!\n− Spend the time to write and craft your messages, and practice them aloud. Then review, edit and iterate.\n− If you feel the shadows of fear—inner critics, voices of comparison, or even shame—begin by acknowledging the feeling. It’s OK: you are human. Then come back to your passion, your purpose for presenting, and move forward.\nDo not attempt to be perfect or fearless. Dare to prepare, and dare to present.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/02/16/2018-02-16-the-darkest-hour-presentation-lessons/","summary":"","tags":["Presentations","Tips"],"title":"3 presentation lessons from The Darkest Hour"},{"author":"Pierre Morsa","contents":"\nI am not a naive man. I have reasonable doubts that Santa does not really exist. So instead of writing a letter that I knew he would not answer I thought it was time to refresh the Ideas on Stage Brand, which hasn’t changed since the creation of the company in 2010.\nWe started with the font. We really love Gotham, the masterpiece from Tobias Frere-Jones. Its iconic design is built on a strong lineage of geometric sans serif fonts. It’s been used with great success by Obama’s campaign and on bags of crisps. We think it conveys the image of professionalism and reliability that we carry with us everywhere.\nNext was the logo. The original one drew some of its inspiration from an old Apple app for podcasts. But despite investing a significant number of minutes in its design it was definitely lacking subtlety and refinement. We tried many different ideas, some good, some “interesting”. In the end we decided we wanted to keep a link with our beginnings, and at the same time add subtle clues about who we are. The new logo has three circles. The big orange one represents the presence of the Speaker on stage. The small white circle is the head of the Speaker, the dot on the i of ideas, and the inner circle. The small orange circle breaks with the mold; it’s the outer circle, the one where the Speaker moves forward and connects with the audience.\nAfter working on the font and logo, I still had time to write a letter to Santa. But instead we chose to spend time on refreshing the look of our website, to our new visual identity. We simplified the navigation and made it more visual.\nBy then it was early January and too late to write my letter to Santa. I don’t believe in him but I hope he hasn’t blacklisted me for next year.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2018/01/26/2018-01-26-new-brand-new-design/","summary":"","tags":["Design","Brand"],"title":"New brand, new design"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"For the third year running, Ideas on Stage was very happy to partner with the TEDx Saclay conference, which took place this November 30, 2017 in the brand-new CentraleSupélec amphitheater at the Plateau de Saclay on the powerful theme of “Serving the Living”.\nTEDx Saclay Keeping standards typically high, this year’s event boasted a rich program of speakers including a few notably prestigious guests such as Cédric Villani \u0026ndash; renowned mathematician and member of the French National Assembly \u0026ndash; as well as artists, scientists, students, entrepreneurs and even a Guinness World Record gamer (Kayane).

From Friday September 29th through Sunday evening on the 1st of October, Marion Chapsal and her co-facilitator Evelyn McKelvie will guide eight willing and ready women on a journey to find \u0026ndash; or fine-tune \u0026ndash; their public voice and take the stage alongside, you guessed it, horses. They call this workshop and retreat \u0026ldquo;The Heroine\u0026rsquo;s Journey\u0026rdquo;.\nIn Evelyn’s June article on “Slaying the Dragon of Fear”, it’s clear that she and Marion share a synergy in their coaching mission even though they come from opposite ends of the pond, as in Canada and France.\nExcuse me? Let me back up. Like Marion, Evelyn is a longtime Leadership Coach, working with Corporate Executives mainly through facilitating retreats. However, she is also the Founder of Equine Coach, an organization which “focuses on leadership development, mindfulness, and enhanced communication skills through working and playing with horses”.\nShe sees how spending hands-on time with horses is a transformational learning opportunity that connects people back to nature and their own intuitive emotional intelligence.\nIn Evelyn’s words: “Whether or not you are a corporate leader, an entrepreneur, a teacher, an aspiring politician or activist, or a mom who wants to be a role model for her daughter”, being comfortable speaking with a microphone, being filmed or taking the stage in any way is key to building and flourishing in a career.\nMarion Chapsal, Chief Learning Officer and creator of Women on Stage, is also fully aware of this truth. Why? Because having worked with countless professionals including young female entrepreneurs to global political leaders, her life’s work is dedicated in many ways to nourishing and reinforcing women’s power and presence in their life and work, on or off-stage.\nWhen answering the question “Why women only workshops?” Marion answers:\nWomen really get to speak! They\u0026rsquo;re less likely to be interrupted, and if they are, they will not remain silent as they might when interrupted by a man.\nWomen more easily overcome their self-censorship in a safe environment of their female peers, which enables a sense of trust and transparency.\nWomen have the space to identify specific issues and personal/professional needs.\nWomen develop a collaborative conversation and weave a support network.\nShe goes on to share that “as a result, once we [women] have addressed the psycho-sociological factors and established trust and belonging, with a bit of technique and ongoing practice and growing awareness, every woman can cultivate a voice that’s strong, clear, resonant and effective.” Marion goes deeper on the subject of gender-balanced leadership in her talk at TEDxStuttgart, using the age-old story of Goldilocks in a less traditional way.\nSo, we see there is an important alchemy in [women-only spaces] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-women-only_us_58d04f10e4b07112b64730e4), like The Heroine’s Journey, for their ability to maximize individual transformation through gender-common group intention and action. That said, this newly generated energy and confidence must certainly not stay limited to the space between women.\nLike a roaring fire starts at the level of an ember, tended by a gentle and consistent source of air, female leadership can be sparked among female peers but must grow to illuminate all in a mix of environments and audiences.\nSo how did two women with rather unique coaching backgrounds decide to blend their passion and expertise in a three-day workshop?\n“When I first met Marion early in 2016 we talked for hours about our passions and strengths in the work we do. I knew Marion had a unique and powerful model that helps women cross that threshold and take centre stage with comfort. Our overlapping areas of interest around Presence meant that soon we were planning a joint retreat that exploits the power of our two modalities - being on the stage and being in the round pen.” Words by Evelyn McKelvie.\nI hear there are still a few places left. So, if this calls to you, or makes you think of a friend, manager or colleague who would benefit, you can find details and registration here. And, with TED 2018 in Vancouver coming up, I can just imagine the presentations brewing or in brainstorm phase that would flourish in this type of workshop.\n\"A woman with a voice is by definition a strong woman.\" - Melinda Gates.\n","description":"","permalink":"/news/2017/09/04/2017-09-04-taking-female-leadership-by-the-reins/","summary":"","tags":["Women","Events","Retreat","Training","Canada"],"title":"Taking Female Leadership by the Reins"},{"author":"Rose Bloomfield","contents":"It’s a simple fact that most successful startups are run by men. Why? Firstly, there are more men than women who decide - or dare - to start companies. Secondly, men are more successful at raising funds than women, and even those women who do raise funds end up raising less, on average, than their male counterparts. Having spent two years playing in the Silicon Valley arena myself, I’ve seen this truth first hand both in California and now in France. It’s a sad state of affairs, and it needs to change.\nEvents like Be a boss, happening this September 21st in Paris, aim to encourage women to start and run their own companies, and help them to succeed. At Ideas on Stage, we care deeply about redressing the gender balance, ensuring women have every opportunity to build their careers, and helping them to make and take these opportunities with both hands.\nSo, we’re very happy that for the third year running, Phil Waknell, our Chief Inspiration Officer at Ideas on Stage, has been invited to deliver two keynotes at Be a boss, aiming to inspire the many female entrepreneurs to pitch themselves and their companies brilliantly, and help them to raise funds and attract clients. Given his experience helping literally hundreds of start-ups prepare and deliver powerful pitches that win contests and raise millions, I asked Phil about his thoughts on the matter.\n“Many of the best pitchers I’ve seen are women,” says Phil, who believes that in fact women have many advantages over men when it comes to pitching. “I find women generally spend more time preparing and thinking about what their audience needs, and more time rehearsing, whereas too many men have a tendency to ‘wing it’ and lean on their skills and charisma. That puts women at a great advantage, because preparation is the most important key to pitch success”.\nSo why do women raise funds less often than men? “Partly it’s because the investment community is still very male-dominated,” explains Phil, “and consciously or subconsciously that leads them to invest more easily in men. Plus, it’s a unfortunate fact of life that any minority needs to reach higher standards just to get an even chance, and among startup entrepreneurs women are still a very small minority. This is changing but there’s a long way to go, so women need to pitch at least as well as men, and ideally even better.”\nSo why is it that those women who make it over this barrier and convince investors still end up raising lower amounts than men? “I’ve heard this explained simply: women ask for less capital. Is this because of lower ambitions, lower expectations or lower self-confidence? I think they all play a part.”\nThat said, what does this mean for women looking to raise funds? “Like so much in life, it comes down to skills and attitude,” says Phil. “Learning how to create and deliver a fantastic pitch is vital for any entrepreneur, and building those skills will help women to build their self-confidence. As long as your startup is worth investing in and your business plan is credible, a powerful pitch delivered with a confident, positive attitude and a strong ambition will hook investors. And I truly believe that with this kind of pitch and attitude, a woman has a better chance of standing out than a man.”\nTo see Phil’s keynote and many other great speakers, sign up for Be a boss here - note that the event will be in French.\nIf you can’t make it to Be a boss, or you don’t speak French, why not sign up for our women-only course Women on Stage, led by Marion Chapsal, one of Europe’s leading specialists in gender-balanced leadership and coach to many top female executives. She is also leading a power-packed women’s retreat and training, The Heroine’s Journey, this September 29-October 1 in beautiful British Columbia to empower women to find their voice and take the stage.\nBe a boss 2017 - links and information Event program: http://www.be-a-boss.com/programme-complet\nRegistration for Be a boss: http://www.be-a-boss.com/inscriptions\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Beaboss2017/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Beaboss2017\nPrior to founding Ideas on Stage in 2010, Phil was manager at Procter \u0026amp; Gamble and commercial director at Hewlett-Packard.

It was a privilege getting to work with the event’s Master of Ceremonies (MC), Alain Chauveau, as well as with four of the ten “TED style” expert presenters to support them in clarifying their core messages and structuring a 15-minute presentation that would leave the audience motivated and empowered.\nAmong the group were presenters Bruno Teboul, SVP Science \u0026amp; Innovation at Keyrus and author of Robotariat, Stéphan Aver, founder of Aaqius creators of the consumer-safe hydrogen canister STOR-H, Guillaume Marolleau, Head of Digital and Consumer Experience at Fleury Michon, and Joël Ruet, Chairman of The Bridge Tank.\nIt’s not the easiest for French professionals at this level to meet in August when most of France is on vacation, but each presenter made the time\u0026ndash;even if it meant taking a skype coaching call at midnight after a dinner in China just days before the event.\nBrainstorming, Day 2 - Photo by Troisième Voix @3voixcom Aug 29\nNow two months into working at Ideas on Stage, what stands out most is the level of quality, intelligence and heart of the organizations and individuals we get to interface with, including our team internally.

For thousands of years, many of the most talented speakers could be found not in a shop or office but in a place of worship.\nAsk people which public speaker they most admire, and many will point to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. He spoke powerfully and inspired his audiences, and of the well-known speakers of the last century he was certainly among the best. Yet go to many Southern Baptist churches and you will find unknown preachers who speak with a similar style and no less power.\nReligion today in many Western communities in particular is facing a decline in congregations and a loss of interest among the young. It is all the more important for the heads of those congregations to be able to speak powerfully, to inspire their followers, and not only keep them coming back but to get them to bring their families and friends.\nTo be blunt, presentation skills are of the utmost importance for preachers, yet they are not always taught how to write or deliver a good sermon.\nThe Diocese of Toulouse, in the south of France, has decided it’s time to invest in their preachers’ presentation skills, so this October, Ideas on Stage will distill all of its expertise in storytelling, oratory and inspiration and take it to Toulouse for a workshop that promises to be very different from our usual sessions with startups, TED speakers and business executives, but just as important and impactful.\nSo, who teaches the preachers?

And as always the speakers were amazing and working on very different fields from gravitational waves to cyborg rights fondation or NGO activist. You can find a biography and works of each and everyone of them here\nBut what is a paradigm shift ? A paradigm shift is when the world conception of something changes completely. Like when people realized that the earth was no longer at the center of the universe, or the Darwinian revolutions. History of science is full of those paradigm shift that are become even more numerous as new discoveries are made. And being part of that shift, helping new ideas come to us is truly amazing.\nThis time it was our coach Joe Ross who did the coaching. And he was highly praised.\n“Joe is a master craftsman when it comes to speech coaching and attention to performance detail. Joe’s highly knowledgeable focus, expertise, and insights were an invaluable asset toward the great success of my TED Talk.” Christopher Emerson\n“If the talk went well, it was in no small part thanks to you Joe. It was delightful working together, and you used just the right amount of push while respecting what I felt I had to say. I’ve done many talks over the years, yet this was the first time I was mentored, and hesitant though I was, I found it most helpful. Thank you Joe. (Please feel free to quote this—it is all true!!)\u0026quot;. Henry Mintzberg, Cleghorn Professor of Management Studies\n“I really enjoyed working with Joe Ross in preparing for a TEDx presentation. He was remarkably artful in taking my fixed points of departure — content, background, and worldview — and gently forming it into something that fit the constraints of the TEDx format, and helping pace me in preparing for it in a timely way. But I did not fully appreciate his contribution to the success of the TEDx event until I saw him during the final rehearsals with the full collection of presenters, who represented a very broad sample across subject matter, level of familiarity with public speaking, innate inclination to communicate in that medium, and simple preparedness. The end result came across as an integrated whole, and this had a lot to do with Joe’s coaching on the individual level and his ability to knit it all together.” Dr. David Shoemaker, (scientist who discovered the Gravitational waves)\nAs with all TedX events, the videos of the speakers will be available online in a couple of weeks so follow their youtube channel to get more info.\nWe will also be posting those videos on our Youtube channel along with many videos of previous events so do not hesitate to have a look.\n","description":"","permalink":"/project/tedx-mcgill-2016/","summary":"","tags":["TEDx","Events"],"title":"TEDX McGill 2016"},{"author":"","contents":"To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device.

While getting the best possible equipment costs thousands of dollars/euros, we think it’s overkill for most people. There are three key elements you need to pay attention to: ease of access, reliability of the conference and clear audio. In addition, having good video quality is going to look more professional, but you definitely don’t need a high-end cam to achieve good results. Here is a setup that works on Mac and Windows PCs and should deliver a completely satisfactory experience to your viewers:\nA cable or fiber connection (probably the hardest thing to get if you don’t live in the right area), with at least 5Mbps upload speed. Zoom as the videoconferencing software. Good headphones and microphones. Apple Airpods work well and have good microphones, a common weakness of other Bluetooth earbuds. A Logitech c920s webcam. The step-up: build a semi-pro environment for remote presentations Do you really want to shine and give the best impression during your videoconference? Then it’s time to step up! Each element of the following list will definitely improve the overall quality of your remote presentation.\nA fiber connection is the most reliable option to deliver high-quality video over the internet. This is because when we talk about videoconferencing line speed is just one factor. The other ones are latency and jitter. In that regard fiber optic connections provide a lower latency (the lower the better) and a very stable jitter. Zoom remains our software of choice. Studio headphones. Sony MDR-7506 are sturdy and time-tested headphones used in many professional studios. If you prefer a more discreet look, I like the Shure SE215 IEMs. A large diaphragm condenser microphone. The USB Blue Yeti is a good choice and not too expensive. Be aware, though, that these microphones will pick up any sound and require a quiet room. A Logitech Brio webcam. Although the default colors are not better than the c920s, with proper calibration it can deliver a better image. I also chose that webcam because the field of view can be narrowed or expanded, giving me more options. But the much cheaper c920s is often a better choice because it offers good quality out of the box and is easier to use. Additional lighting, such as a LED light ring. This will improve the lighting in your video. They can be found for a couple dozen euros on a certain online marketplace named after mythical female warriors. A neutral backdrop to hide the clutter. The next step up is getting a digital mixing console, the appropriate gear to connect to it, soundproof your room, add professional lighting and use a DSLR to capture video. But it’s really overkill for 99% of use cases, and if you are not comfortable operating such equipment during a live presentation it may make things worse, not better.\nProvide Easy Access to Your Videoconference Not being able to access the videoconference because of technical problems is the number one reason why people don’t like videoconferences. Nothing more frustrating than being blocked at the door because of a technical problem. While not foolproof, Zoom is the solution we’ve had more success with, and in our experience has a lower connection failure rate compared to Skype. Why? Because it’s easy to use and guides the user by the hand. Simply clicking on a link gives direct access to the meeting room, and if the software is not installed it offers you to download and install it (with your consent).\nPro tip: ask your participants to test their audio and video before the meeting. Non-working audio and video are the number one reason why most videoconferences don’t start on time. To do so in Zoom, go to the microphone icon at the bottom left, click on the up arrow next to it, and select “test speaker and microphone.”\nWelcoming Your Participants If people know each other, you can get down to business quickly. Otherwise, make sure that people are ready to start and won’t interrupt the session. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing more annoying for participants than having to redo the intro several times because of late participants or people interrupting because they have a technical problem.\nUsing PowerPoint for Remote Presentations Any presentation software can be used. We’re going to use PowerPoint because it remains the industry standard.\nStart by Sharing your screen in Zoom. The easiest option is to simply share the whole screen. To do so, click on the “Share Screen” button at the bottom of the Zoom window, then select “Desktop 1” or whatever the name is for the whole screen view.\nNext, start the Slide Show in PowerPoint, so participants can see your slides full screen (you may need to click on your presentation again to put the focus on PowerPoint). If you want to use PowerPoint\u0026rsquo;s presenter view and see your notes, you will need two screens, for example a laptop connected to an external monitor or television.\nYou can then start to deliver your presentations in the best conditions possible. Use the left and right arrows to move from one slide to another.\nHighlighting an element on your slide With Zoom and PowerPoint, you actually do not have one, but two different options to do live annotations to your slides.\nFrom PowerPoint: move the mouse to the bottom left corner. A series of icons will show up. Clicking on the pen icon will show a pop-up menu with various options to highlight specific parts of your slide.\nFrom Zoom: in the Zoom floating tools palette, click the “Annotate” pen icon. A second floating palette, the annotation palette, will appear right under the main one, giving you options to annotate part of the screen.\nShould you use the PowerPoint or Zoom annotation tools? Here are the key differences between the two:\nPowerPoint annotations will be automatically cleared when you move from one slide to another. Zoom annotations will remain on the shared screen until you decide to clear them by clicking on the trash icon in the annotation palette. PowerPoint annotations are easier to use for the presenter, because they don’t need to constantly switch the focus back and forth between Zoom and PowerPoint. Zoom annotations can be done by all participants (click on the More button in the Zoom floating palette for more options such as hiding participant annotations or showing the participant names next to the annotations). How to be an engaging remote presenter If presentations during face-to-face meetings can be boring, bad remote presentations can be insanely boring. Because we have no direct communication with the audience, because we lack the physical presence, because our brain must process the additional workload of using the videoconferencing software properly, it’s easy to sound like a robot reading a bunch of slides. Here is our advice to continue to sound engaging in a remote setting:\nThe most important thing is to keep a natural and energetic tone of voice. Keeping a conversational tone, your tone, is key to delivering a pleasing and engaging presentation online.\nPro Tip: my setup allows me to listen to my own voice when presenting. The sound of my microphone is fed back into my headphones. A lot of people hate to hear their own voice, but listening to yourself is the only way to be sure of how you sound for your audience.\nIt’s harder to detect clues in a virtual conference if participants need a break or want you to slow down. To avoid losing them, don’t speak for too long without interruptions. Include frequent exchanges between participants.\nDon’t forget to put yourself in the participant’s shoes. Add variety to avoid monotony. Divide the presentation in smaller sections. Vary the rhythm and style of each section. What he will see is a video, close to what he would see on television or YouTube. You never see slides full of bullets on either of these media for a good reason: it’s ineffective and boring. Design your presentation so that it looks like a good video with your narration on top. Television avoids small text because it can be hard to read on small screens; we don\u0026rsquo;t recommend to attend a webinar from a smartphone because of the small screen size, but keep in mind that some tablets can have screens as small as 7 inches, so it\u0026rsquo;s best to use a large font for the text.\nWe can train your employees deliver great presentations remotely, and we can do it … remotely! We can also help you set up webinars to communicate your message to all your employees across multiple countries.\nReplaying the videoconference One of the advantages of Zoom is that you can record your session. After you finish your session, you can simply give a link to people who were absent so they can watch your presentation. It’s a great way to increase its impact on your organization without having to give it multiple times.\nIf you want an edited version of your remote presentation, with a corporate intro and outro, cutting out the unnecessary pauses and hesitations and highlighting the key messages, we can do that for you.\n","description":"A complete guide on how to deliver great presentations remotely using videoconferencing software.","permalink":"/how-to-deliver-presentations-remotely/","summary":"What you need to deliver great presentations remotely: gear, software, setup, animation.

Your document or presentation was received, but will it be read? Will it be remembered? And most importantly, will it be acted upon? Or, did you just waste your time . . .\nEach year companies create millions of presentations and documents. Yet most of them are boring, hard to understand and lack a clear purpose. The information is there, but it doesn’t stick; and so, it is quickly forgotten.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Presentations and documents can be engaging, clear, and to the point. They are not doomed to slowly collect dust in the bottom of the receiver’s inbox. And because your competitors’ presentations are likely to be unappealing, it’s easy to get noticed! How? By combining reason and emotion.\nMaking the receiver hear your message is not enough. You have to catch their interest to make them want to listen.

This is how Amazon runs their meetings, and it works because that’s how human brains work. Meetings that might have taken two hours end up taking 25-30 minutes, even with 10 minutes of quiet reading at the start.\nIt might sound odd for a presentation company to say how presentations are very ineffective – but that’s only half the story. Presentations are poor at information, but excellent at transformation. If you want to change what people believe, feel and do, presentations can be amazingly powerful.\nImagine you are pitching to raise funds for a project or start-up. You tell them everything about your idea – but they refuse to fund you. Did you succeed? No.\nNow imagine you focus on making them feel trusting and confident in you and your team; on making them believe that your idea will work, and that it is a good investment – and on telling them only the few things they need to know to support those beliefs and feelings. Will that give you a better chance of funding? Of course.\nSo don’t inform: transform. Change what they believe, feel and do, and you will achieve your objectives.\nHow can you work out what transformations you need to make, and what to say to achieve them? This is where you can use the Audience Transformation Roadmap™, a simple and powerful tool created by Ideas on Stage, and shared with the world via a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license. You are free to use this non-commercially and share it, as long as you properly attribute it to Ideas on Stage.\n(Non-commercial use means that you can use it yourself to prepare your own presentations, even business presentations; but you can’t sell it as a product or part of a service to your clients.)\nHere’s how it works. You first ask yourself four questions related to the subject of your presentation, filling in the first column with your answers:\nWhat does my audience know? (and what don’t they know, if it’s important?) What do they believe, or think they know? What do they feel? What do they do? Make a clear distinction between what they believe and what they feel. Beliefs are things they think or expect to be true; feelings are emotions. For example, they believe it is nearly time for lunch; they feel hungry.\nThen you go back up the right-hand column, answering the questions:\nWhat would I like them to do after my presentation? What should they feel, to make them want do that? What do they need to believe, so they feel that way and take those actions? What do they need to know afterwards? By doing this, you will realize that the main transformation you need to create is in the feelings and actions of your audience. This orients your presentation less towards information (which, remember, isn’t what presentations are good for) and more towards generating beliefs, feelings and actions, which is what presentations do best.\nFinally, you then go back down the ‘transformation column’ in the middle, using sticky notes to brainstorm for ideas on what you can say, show and do in your presentation to make these transformations from left (before) to right (after). Later, you can take these sticky notes off the Roadmap, and arrange them into a suitable storyline.\nWe invented this technique, and even we are often amazed at how easy it is to arrange these ideas into a presentation storyline, with hardly anything missing and hardly any superfluous ideas. It truly is a short-cut to a powerful presentation, and we use this technique with our clients and to prepare our own presentations. It’s our most powerful method, and we’re giving it to you to use, so you can join our Business Presentation Revolution and help us to cure the world of boring, ineffective presentations.\nIf you would like the help of an experienced facilitator to help you to run a brainstorming session using the Audience Transformation Roadmap™, the Ideas on Stage team would be happy to help: contact us at info@ideasonstage.com.

Ideas on Stage is an agency specialized in corporate presentations with over 13 years of experience. We have collectively coached and trained thousands of speakers in all industries. We have an enormous amount of experience in preparing TED style presentations with over 300 TEDx speakers coached in dozens of TED events in France, the UK and the United States.\nTo prepare our speakers, we use traditional public speaking techniques, but also use new technologies during our coaching sessions such as virtual reality tools. We also use the most recent methods of visual creation and storytelling.\nThe Fundamental Techniques of Public Speaking Public speaking is very connected to the oral arts of theater. It’s an ancient practice, built over thousands of years, and is a pillar of our modern societies. The Greeks were probably the first to have formalized the codes. These techniques will give you presence and confidence on stage. It is necessary to master them, but they must be completed with storytelling techniques and visuals for a delivery that is complete, effective and above all memorable.\nThese delivery techniques mainly cover the elements of posture, breath, voice, eye contact and gesture. We will explain step by step how to become a great speaker.\nPosture: Grounded but Not Fixed Posture is the first element of successful delivery. A confident and stable posture, committed but not tense, will reinforce your presence on stage and will project a positive image of yourself. On the other hand, a closed and weak posture, with repetitive gestures linked to stress, will show a lack of confidence which can negatively impact your speech.\nA great posture starts from the ground, from the feet. Put your feet flat, in good solid contact with the floor and well spaced (hip width apart). In this position you are stable and solid.\nKeep your legs straight, tonic, without being too tense or locked. If you need to walk on the stage, every movement should remain natural.\nYour hips, chest and shoulders are aligned vertically above the feet, with a nice and straight spine giving an upright, tonic posture, but not too rigid. You should be able to move comfortably from spot to spot.\nYour head should be straight as if an invisible wire was lightly pulling your head towards the ceiling. The most important thing is to have great alignment: chest—neck—head as this allows you to breathe effortlessly.\nIn order to master this posture, try this Alexander technique: start with your head, shoulders and arms doubled over in front of you, feet flat on the ground. Stay down there and let your muscles relax, feel your shoulders loosen and body adjust to the position and take deep breaths. Then, slowly come back up, vertebrae by vertebrae—the hips then spine slowly uncurling, then the shoulders and finally the head. Check your body for any tension and lightly shrug your shoulders to rid yourself of any tension. Then try repeat the exercise. The aim is to improve alignment in the body and rid yourself of tension that deforms your posture. Physical tension affects the posture and the voice, which ultimately reduces the power of your presence.\nIf you are one of these people who can’t stop moving on stage, on the spot or going too far left or right, we’ll give you a tip in the section “resolving typical issues with delivery.”\nBreath A calm, deep and supported breath will give energy to your voice. With a bit of practice, it will also help you deal with your stress before entering the stage.\nBreath and posture are connected for a simple mechanical reason: it’s easier to breathe when we hold ourselves straight than when we are hunched. The air passes without effort through the nose and mouth to the lungs.\nTo work on your breath, start by adopting a good posture, as described above. Close your eyes. If you have issues with balance keep your eyes open but focus on your breathing and everything that you can feel and observe during this exercise.\nThe first exercise consists of breathing slowly, calmly and deeply, in and out. Imagine that the air is going right to the bottom of your lungs. Continue to breathe in until your lungs are full, this will work all your muscles and in particular the diaphragm. Repeat the exercise several times to discover this area, always remembering to go at a pace which is comfortable for you. To help you follow the mechanical movements and understand your breathing process better, place a hand over your solar plexus and another on your belly.\nNext, try to alter your breathing. Slow it down as much as possible. Or in reverse accelerate it. Take the time to feel the impact of slow and rapid breathing and how it can affect you, without feeling dizzy. Try to find the rhythm that seems most natural for you, a rhythm where you feel most at ease. Continue to breathe deeply in and out without exaggerating. For public speaking, your breathing needs to feel normal and unforced.\nThe following exercise will help you learn how to build a column of air that connects the diaphragm to the vocal chords.\nFirst, try to imagine a column between the solar plexus and the vocal chords. It is a column of air that is powered by the diaphragm and sent up through the vocal chords to make sound. Breathe in, then breathe out and count. Begin by doing it noiselessly, just a faint hissing sound. Count to 10 in your head for one hiss. Repeat and try to increase the count each time you breathe out; count to 12, 14, 16, 18, etc. This exercise will help you build your breathing capacity.\nThe next step is to repeat the exercise on a big breath but this time, while exhaling, make a humming sound instead of a hiss. Do this a few times to warm the vocal chords. Then tune the hum to the sound of various open vowels: “aaaah, aaay, eeh, aaay, aaah.” Repeat the exercise using other vowel sounds. “aaah, orrr, oooh, orrr, aaah,” but always begin with the hum. Keep practicing until the sound comes naturally with a deeper and calmer breath.\nVoice To simplify things, there are two types of voices: the voice from the chest and the voice from the head. A voice from the chest will be deeper but harder to project and make audible for the audience. A voice from the head is easier to amplify naturally, but if it’s pushed it will become high-pitched and grate on the ear. In order to feel the difference, place one hand on your chest and another one on the top of your head. Start by producing a deep vocal sound with the vowel “oooh.” You should feel a vibration in your chest. It’s the amplifying effect from the thoracic cage, exactly like the hollow body of a guitar. Then try emitting a higher-pitched sound such as “iiiii.” You should feel your skull vibrating. Try to change the tonality between the deeply pitched and high pitched without forcing anything. Try to discover the pitches of your natural resonance range.\nWe’re not trying to become singers. For public speaking and presenting, we advise you to work on the amplification of your “natural pitch.” We all have our own particular natural “timbre” and “pitch.” It is unwise to try to change that, even if you wish your natural pitch were lower or higher. There is nothing to gain from sounding like someone else and the downside is that you will sound artificial and unauthentic. We cannot ask a tenor to sing like a baritone. The best thing we can do is take what nature gave us and learn how to use its full potential towards our audience.\nTo work your natural pitch and range, actively aim to speak so that the sound is coming out of the front of your mouth rather than the back of your throat. Again, pitching on a hum in your warm-up will help to develop this and bring the voice forward. Use your hands on your face to feel the vibrations. It is probably worth mentioning here that, if you’re serious about working on your voice, you really need to work with a coach as this part of your development cannot be mastered via an article, it requires professional help and feedback.\nFinally, certain people have much stronger natural voices than others. If your voice is particularly soft, we advise you to use a microphone, even if the room is not that big. Don’t be shy about this, it will save your voice and avoid frustrating your audience. Also, from my experience, shouting will create tension with your audience, it’s much better to use normally spoken tones, amplified by a sound system. If you try to push your voice too much, you will end up sounding tired and dry. Your voice will become worse and worse and you will lose confidence, which is something you want to avoid, especially if you need it over several days.\nEye Contact Eye contact is one of the keys to become a great public speaker, at least in western culture. Without it, an audience will feel excluded and disengage. Even a conversation between two people needs eye contact, to gauge the non-verbal cues and garner the intention of the person talking to us. As a presenter, it gives us energy as we ride on the reactions and engagement of our audience. It also helps us find the right rhythm and add pauses whenever necessary.\nEye contact needs to be directed to individuals and include the whole crowd. You should be able to target one person in the audience, but also look in every direction to address everyone. I once watched a TED talk where the speaker stared into the same spot in the audience the entire time and most of the audience eventually lost interest, or had trouble staying engaged. We cannot afford to make our audiences work so hard.\nFor this exercise, you probably don’t have an audience in front of you to practice. One solution is to place a couple of rows of Post-its on a blank wall in front of you, to represent individual members of the audience. Start by greeting the “audience members” in one gesture and welcome phrase then focus on one particular “Post-it” audience member and address it with a complete sentence. Stay with this same “target” until the end of the phrase/sentence, then move on to a new audience member with the following sentence/phrase. Another way to do it is to project a picture of an audience on a large screen, it works really well. Another tool we use to train people to establish good eye contact with an audience is virtual reality.\nIdeally, you should be able to find the right balance between making a meaningful connection with each audience member and shifting your gaze in another direction. Stay long enough with each audience member to send them an idea, or a phrase before moving on to the next in a natural pattern (try not to be too mechanical). At first, it can feel a bit like a regimented exercise, but with practice it will become fluid and natural, and greatly improve your connection with the audience.\nIn a small room, with just a few people sitting opposite you, it’s important to address everyone. In a bigger room with 20 + people, it’s more difficult to address everyone but at least try to establish eye contact with as many people as possible. You will eventually connect with everyone. For those of you aiming to give a big speech at an event or addressing a very large audience you will need to divide the crowd in front of you in zones, you will then be able to establish eye contact with people not only in the front, but also the middle left, right, back left, etc. From a certain distance, you’re making eye contact with everyone.\nGesture Good gesture will make you look comfortable on stage and will help you reinforce the key ideas of your talk. Gesture is a lot simpler than it seems.\nGood gesture is natural, open and expressive. Natural because it matches your style. If you are very demonstrative, you can make a lot of large gestures. If you are more reserved, fewer but subtler gestures will better fit your style. Avoid thinking you need to change your personality to become a good public speaker. We’ve seen many introverts being told to behave like extroverts, it simply doesn’t work. Good gesture can help the audience better understand what we are saying. It punctuates our talk, illustrates our stories and communicates non-verbal signals.\nBefore we explain how to practice gestures, here are some gestures to avoid:\nDon’t put your hands in your pocket. It looks nonchalant and noncommittal. Don’t cross your arms. Contrary to a popular myth, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have a closed attitude. It is simply a comfortable position that many people adopt while standing. But it has been so talked about that it has just become a cliché that everyone accepts, so it’s best to avoid crossing your arms. Don’t hold your hands behind your back. It’s usually a sign that the speaker feels uncomfortable on stage. Michael Bay did this during his CES 2014 talk when he lost his prompter. Don’t rub your hands. Bill Gates was always doing this. It makes him look like he is preparing something evil (especially when he released mosquitos into the audience during his TED talk!) It’s the gesture that Mr. Burns from the Simpsons always does Don’t point your finger (whatever the finger). This is a gesture that is considered inappropriate in many cultures. If you need to point at a direction, do it with your whole hand, palm open. In order to practice gestures, start by adopting a rooted stance. Find your breathing rhythm. Let your hands hang by your side. Imagine that you’re establishing eye contact with your audience. This position feels awkward and exposed. Why? Because this position feels vulnerable, without any psychological protection. It feels “naked.” Paradoxically, someone watching you from the audience will perceive you as confident and relaxed. This is called the comfort zone paradox: as you open your body, you feel less protected, but you look more accessible and confident. When you close your body language with closed gestures such as crossed arms, you feel more protected but look aloof and insecure.\nFrom the neutral, open position, start talking. Use your hands and arms to naturally punctuate the key moments of your talk. Once again, outside of the gestures to avoid or gestures which are not coherent and interfere with your communication (parasitic gestures), using natural and spontaneous gestures is often the best approach. If you’re speaking about something simple, don’t make it look complex with elaborate or big gestures, keep it small and simple. Match your gestures to your vocal rhythm. Slow gestures with slow rhythm, for example.\nDon’t forget that you are a mirror to the audience, so reverse the lines you are tracing in the air between east and west, for example. This requires a bit of practice, but it will make your gestures clearer and more logical.\nTo conclude with gestures, I cannot stress how important it is not to try to stage your gestures too much. They need to be natural. If you have rehearsed and “own” your material, the right gestures will come spontaneously.\nSpeaking on stage Now that you know the basic techniques to speak on stage, we will see how we can apply these techniques throughout a talk, from the moment we take ownership of the stage to the conclusion.\nTaking the stage A great entrance will give you energy, good connection with the audience and will help you to establish your presence. Before taking the stage, you may be well waiting in the wings, sitting in the reserved seats on the front row or standing around somewhere nearby. Once it’s your turn, take the stage with a solid volition, not too pushed, not too relaxed. Establish eye contact with the audience as soon as possible. Look at them as you take your position center stage. Once at the center, allow yourself a few seconds to take ownership of the stage. Plant yourself, open your shoulders and connect with the audience with a smile and open posture. When you are ready, simply begin to talk. Real leaders only start when they are ready. They are masters of their own time.\nA little trick to prevent you from rushing your start is to start talking only after you count to 3 from the moment you plant your feet.\nThe first minute The first minute of public speaking is the most difficult, in particular if you feel particularly stressed or something didn’t go as planned. The best way to succeed during the first minute is to rehearse not until you can do it right, but until you can’t do it wrong. Rehearse your entrance and first minute to the point it becomes subconscious. You are in effect placing in rails that will keep you safe in case something happens that could throw you off course. You can even go further and master the first 5 minutes. This, in turn, will help you deal with the stress. Don’t worry about rehearsing so much that you will sound artificial. People who sound artificial are actually people who did not rehearse enough to be comfortable on stage.\nMaintain Your Connection With the Audience During the rest of the presentation, apply the methods explained in this guide. Use eye contact to establish a dialogue with each person, look everywhere around the audience. No need to rush.\nConclude your talk. In most cultures, the magic words that indicates that you have finished your talk is “Thank you.” If the audience is applauding, wait a bit, then slowly leave the stage. If possible, maintain eye contact while you exit the stage. Bravo, you’ve just concluded a wonderful talk!\nHow to Solve Common Problems Associated With Public Speaking Stress, “umm,” involuntary movements, monotony, this section contains tips on how to eliminate the problems commonly associated with public speaking. Some are quick to correct, others will take hours of practice and experimentation. Don’t be discouraged, and if possible use a coach to get valuable feedback.\nManage Your Stress Public speaking is one of the most feared topics for people as it leaves us vulnerable. Standing in front of an audience, fear of danger, fear of judgment and fear of the unknown can trigger our insecurities. Poor judgment from others, the shame of failure can make our mind go down the rabbit hole. Fortunately, there are several methods which exist to help us manage our stress.\nThe first thing you should remember is that stress is normal and even healthy as long as it’s manageable and not overwhelming. But if the stress becomes too difficult to cope with, it will hinder your performance and reduce the impact of your talk. So what can you do about it? We are all different, and something that works for someone may not work for others. For example, some people are using meditation in order to relax and it works. But for others, meditating might actually increase their stress levels, because the heightened feeling of self-awareness can become overpowering. At any rate, the causes behind the stress as indicated earlier are the same for everyone:\nThe fear of the symbolic death of our ego under the scrutiny and judgment of the audience. This is also linked to the fear of failure. Fear of the unknown, the impossibility to control the future, which can generate anxiety build up until it becomes too stressful. In order to deal with these 2 causes and fight them, there are a number of methods. I will list a few here:\nRehearse, rehearse, rehearse. We will never say it enough. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, failing to prepare is preparing to fail. Practice until you can’t get it wrong. Use virtual reality to desensitize yourself to the fear of judgment from a crowd. When possible, meet your audience beforehand. Practice meditation in order to relax. This will work better if you practice regularly. Avoid focusing on your thoughts, don’t go down the rabbit hole. Keep talking with other speakers backstage to stop your mind from creating imaginary worst-case scenarios. Stay present, keep your eye on the time, where you’re entering from and what’s currently happening. Eliminating vocal ums and errs and other filler words Ums and filler words are the most common language tics when we present. To correct them, we are going to use one of the tools we already talked about. And, surprisingly, it is eye contact.\nWhy do we hesitate with filler vowels and words? Because we think as we speak. A umm is something we unconsciously do when we think and focus on our thoughts. It’s an old human habit to fill the silence as, for most people, silence is not comfortable.\nUms are nearly always accompanied by a systematic movement from the eyes, usually to the ceiling. Observe people who umm and err, it’s an automatic reflex that we all have. So how do you stop it? The simplest thing to do is to stop our natural reflex: instead of turning “inwards” towards your thoughts, keep your mind directed towards the audience by keeping good eye contact. Just fill the space with a pause instead of a vocal sound. You can work with a coach on this, but you can also film yourself, or you can use AI software from PowerPoint to tell you exactly how many times you umm and err, but ultimately, keep your mind and your eyes focused on the audience; with a bit of practice, the parasitic vocal fillers will disappear.\nStopping Parasitic Movement Some people cannot stop moving on stage. Once again, we’re going to use eye contact with the audience to eliminate unconscious movements. To understand why, try a little test: try to move when you speak and keep your eye on someone in the audience. It’s nearly impossible. Good eye contact with someone in the audience keeps you anchored.\nIf you don’t believe us, look at speakers who constantly move around: they are not making meaningful eye contact with the audience. They look at the floor, the ceiling, or vaguely in the direction of the audience but without really seeing them.\nBy keeping constant eye contact, you will stop moving unnecessarily and unconsciously.\nAlways looking in the same direction On stage, we all tend to prefer to look in one direction in particular. Sometimes we even look at the same person during the whole presentation. It is sometimes linked to the “student-teacher” phenomenon: the student watches his or her teacher during the whole presentation because unconsciously he or she is looking for their approval. Believe me, the teacher does not want to be the center of attention during the whole presentation, I’ve been there and it is uncomfortable!\nTo avoid that pitfall, practice using the Post-its and above all, try to detach from the pressures of the task and try to consider each member of the public as equal whatever their position towards you.\nGetting rid of monotony If you have received feedback that your voice is monotonous or lacks dynamics, we advise you to discover and practice the 4 Tempos, demonstrated in a video with Michael and Rose.\nThis video is part of our series The Business Presentation Revolution.\nTo go further This guide contains many elements to give a great talk and win over your audience. But there are other factors which will help you succeed even further.\nDeveloping a Strong Message and Speech You can be an excellent speaker, but if you have nothing to say the audience will resent the fact you made them waste their time. That’s why you should always start your preparation by identifying your key messages. To help you, we have developed a tool called the \u0026ldquo;Audience Transformation Roadmap\u0026rdquo;. It’s a powerful tool that allows you to identify all key messages in order to convince your audience.\nUse of Visuals Visuals are often created with Microsoft PowerPoint, but not exclusively: they could also be posters or objects that you bring on stage. You could also draw on a paperboard or a digital tablet during your talk. It could also be something more elaborate such as a green screen background, especially during online presentations.\nIf you use PowerPoint slides (or another type of software such as Keynote or press), our advice is to make it as simple as possible, and put the minimum of information on those slides. When we have the time, we will write a similar guide on how to produce really great and effective PowerPoint slides.\nWork With a Coach We have tried to make this guide as comprehensive as possible. The art of giving a great talk is like a game of tennis: nobody is born with these skills, we all have to learn how to do it and practice, practice, practice. A public speaking coach will help you master the various techniques described in this guide. Whatever your level, you can only progress.

Acknowledgements The creation of this ultimate TEDx speaker guide wouldn’t have been possible without the help of my colleagues Phil, Rose and Michael, all of whom are certified presentation directors and better coaches than me. We would equally like to thank all the organizers who have already entrusted us with the organization of TEDx and other events and continue to do so.\nThe Path to Building Your TEDx The euphoric invitation moment has passed, you have come back to earth. Now what? Where to begin?\nFirst, make sure that you are available for the date of the event and be certain that you can participate. Nothing is worse for an organizer than to have a speaker abandon their commitment halfway through the preparation process, above all when the program has been already announced. Be sure that you are 100% certain that you can and want to do it before confirming your participation to the organizers.\nReply to the invitation like a professional speaker So you’re certain that you want to take part as a TEDx speaker? Great! Start by sending an email to the organizers with 3 pieces of information and 4 questions.\nYour information:\nConfirm your participation in the event along with the reason why you wish to take part. Mention the subject that you intend to speak about and ask the organizers to confirm that they approve of this topic. Send them your mini biography. Who are you? What is your story? What makes you original? Why do you want to speak at a TED? Don’t write a novel. Ten lines are more than enough. Be very clear about your title (CEO of …, mad inventor of, futurologist, …) because your bio is what will be the most visible on the site and in the program. Questions to the Organizer:\nHow long will I have to speak? One of the golden rules of a TED presentation is to never go over time. Respect the duration given, usually set by the organizers. Popular talk time lengths range between 5 and 18 minutes; between 12 and 15 minutes is the standard for many TEDx events. What are the specifications for my presentation? Should I use PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi? Do they need it in 4:3 or 16:9? Light or dark backgrounds? Are there visual guidelines to follow? Will there be coaching, and if so, what are the dates? If the organizers are worth their salt, they should provide at least one presentation director or coach who will help speakers to prepare their talks. Plan your sessions with the coach in advance as much as possible. It is strongly advised that you accept their help. Working with a professional to hone your TED talk will render your story more impactful, dynamic and memorable. What they will teach you will not only be useful for that particular event, but will offer you knowledge and tools useful for your entire professional career. May I have a speaker release form? This is “the contract” by which you will engage and respect the rules of TEDx. If the organizers don’t send it to you, ask for it, it’s an obligation on their part. If you send all these elements to the organizers from the beginning, they will not only be impressed by your professionalism, but you will feel more at ease and informed at the gate.\nOrganize your preparation Once you confirm your participation, the organizers should confirm the following elements with you:\nYour travel arrangements and accommodation if necessary. The dates and venue for the preparation of your talk with the coach or director. For local conferences, rehearsal times and location details; often a meeting room or theater. For international speakers, coaching sessions are often conducted via videoconferencing using platforms like Zoom, Skype or Teams; be sure to have login details and for that. Expected arrival or show times for the big day. Any tech rehearsal information so you can plan accordingly. If you have the chance to rehearse on stage or in the event space, we highly recommend seizing this opportunity as being familiar with the layout, technicalities and challenges of the space before speaking does everything run more smoothly and relaxes presenter nerves. Prepare to be coached Once you have fixed a date for your first coaching session, you can prepare by doing several things.\nKnow TED: “Have you met TED?” Excuse the pop-culture reference (see How I met your Mother). If you are not familiar with TED or TEDx, the first thing you need to do is visit www.ted.com and watch a few videos to understand why the conference has garnered such a globally positive reputation. Here are some links in English, which will give you a hint of the style and quality of the talks.\nAl Gore: new thinking on the climate crisis Sarah Kay: If I Should Have a Daughter Seth Godin: how to get your ideas to spread Hans Rösling: Asia’s rise how and when Amanda Gorman: The Hill We Climb/Using your voice is a political choice Title it: provide the organizers with the title of your talk. They will need it to prepare the event web site and print their programs. In order to do that they need the title of your talk. Try to be original with your title and avoid non-specific, generalized titles. Try to find something that will hook people’s attention. A question perhaps, or a slogan. Don’t worry, it is common for this step to feel problematic since you are still working on your content.\nShare it: deliver your work in progress! Before your first session, send your coach, and possibly the organizers, your story or script plus any slides for your talk. This will allow the coach to prepare and to better advise you during the session. It is possible that your coach would prefer to help you from scratch. Structure your ideas and visualize or storyboard your slides. If you don’t know how to do this, then the next chapter is for you.\nWrite your story. A good presentation sits on an axis of 3 key elements, which serve the message of your talk:\nA well-structured and captivating Story Strong visuals or Slides A clear and passionate Speaker Define your objective and key messages Before launching yourself into detailed preparation for your talk, don’t forget to take into account the expectations of the organizers, the audience and the context, questions to consider as you define the objective of your talk, or what we call a transformational objective:\nWhat is the current cultural context surrounding your topic at this time? This could be for your subject, market, or in the world. What recent events could alter audience perception of my talk? Why did the organizers choose you? What are their expectations of you or your subject matter? How does it fit into the theme and goal of the event? What change would you like to see in your audience? Fill in the question, “After my presentation, the audience will__________” (know, believe, feel, do) what differently? Transformational objective examples: “After my talk, my audience will … participate in the circular economy.” Or, “ … share about this initiative.” “ … better understand quantum physics.” “ … be more interested in space exploration!” “ … see the humanitarian side of plastic surgery.” “ … feel more optimistic about the world.”\nAfter you set your objective, define your key messages. What is the 1 to 3 things you most want your audience to remember after your talk? Example: 1) AI is changing everything. 2) Humans need to control it or it will control us. 3) Stay curious about AI development and take privacy measures on your devices. This follows a “what, so what, what next” model for setting your key messages.\nThe art of presenting is the subject of a lot of books, it is impossible to explain everything in this document otherwise it would be 500 pages long and no one would read it. So, I made a choice: you’ll find for each point mentioned below, a few yet very powerful tips to help you give a great presentation, “TED Style”.\nKnow How to SCORE Now that you have your objective and key messages, how will you bring them to life powerfully within time? First, know the constraints. One step is to map out your word count by taking the allotted time (say, 10mins) and multiply it by 150 (words per minute), giving you about 1500 words. Now you have a rough idea of the maximum length to speak at a reasonable (Steve Jobs like) pace. Go faster, and you risk sounding rushed or losing your audience.\nHow do you make your talk SCORE?, you’ll find 5 characteristics to help you tell a great story.\nSimple. One way to lose your audience is in complexity. 8–18minutes is not enough time to teach the intricacies of your subject. But it is enough time to make a change in what they know, believe, feel and do. Clear. Is your story clear, concise and concrete? Avoid ideas and terms which are too conceptual. Use examples and anecdotes to show, not tell. Original. The most memorable TEDx speakers do something original, even surprising, to punctuate their point that engages our senses. Bill Gates brought mosquitos on stage. Jamie Oliver presented a wheelbarrow filled with sugar. Phil Waknell launched dozens of balloons while Isaac Getz flung toy monkeys into the crowd. These gestures make a strong impression by being original and unexpected. Related. Everything in your talk should relate to your key messages and ultimately your objective and how it fits into the theme of the event. The more related, the more connected your subject is to the world, current events and the audience. Enjoyable. Don’t push aside your emotions, let them shine. Recount your own powerful experiences to take listeners on an enjoyable ride. If you follow the first five criteria, it’s hard to go wrong. Even if the previous ingredients can help you to build a great TED Talk, ask yourself how your talk can bring something new to your subject, a point of view not yet shared. One more thing: include tweetable lines. The audiences of TED/TEDx are generally very active on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and the like. You will have a better chance of your talk being, er, talked about and shared if you give shareable phrases during your talk that encapsulate your key ideas. It helps to punctuate your presentation and provides the audience sound bites to share. At a similar TED like conference in France, the renowned American speaker and campaigner John Hope Bryant gave many of these great messages. One that really stuck was “Nothing stops a bullet like a job,” which was shared rampantly by the audience afterwards.\nTell Your Story Hook them. As a TEDx speaker, your first words have a huge influence on the rest of your talk. They can arouse curiosity and sympathy from the outset, or put them off, or worse, put them to sleep. This also concerns those watching your talk online. The first 15 seconds are critical in determining whether viewers continue watching or click on to something else. First impressions last. Make sure your introduction hooks your audience. You can do this a question, a shocking statistic, a theatrical demonstration, a piece of music … whatever brings the tone of your topic to life.\nTip: Don’t hesitate to tell the audience where you intend to take them. It’s much easier to follow a speaker when they share outright where they intend to take us. For example “Today, I’m going to tell you how twitter became a tool that can dethrone dictators” I’m going to show you if India and China are going to overtake the average western salary and if so, when…. Then, use a structure that is coherent and simple to develop your story. There are many ways to tell a story. You can use a “chronological structure,” where you give the events in a chronological order. Or follow a question and answer structure. You could tell the end at the beginning. Or take them through the ideal into reality and end with solution.\nIf you’re presenting numbers, give them meaning and make them concrete. For example\nConceptual (bad): The ecological footprint of a European equals X times m2. Concrete (good): The ecological footprint of a European equals 2 football fields. Compare: the fact that Apple sold x million iPhones in one day is impressive. But the fact that apple sold enough iPhone in one day to completely fill Michigan stadium is something else.\nOne more: imagining 1 billion hungry humans is impossible to visualize. But saying 1 human out of 7 is hungry, is much more impactful.\nDon’t try to “sell” your product, your service or your company. It’s forbidden at TED. If you’ve been invited to present your last invention, put the focus on the story behind the conception of the product and the surprises that came from its development. You don’t want to sound like a used car dealer.\nThink about eliminating technical or specialized terms or acronyms. Acronyms do work, however, if you employ them as a pneumonic, such as I.M.P.A.C.T or M.I.R.R.O.R. where the letters stand for something vital in your talk, which you then define.\nAvoid the “Armageddon” syndrome. It’s all a catastrophe, it’s all doomed, everybody is out for themselves. There are more than enough manipulative and pessimistic sources on the internet for messages such as those. This is not part of the TED philosophy, or part of the wider positive mentality your audience is seeking. The conclusion serves as a wrap-up or summary of the key message(s) but can equally be a call to action. What do want your audience to do after your presentation? It’s time to remind them.\nCreate TED-Worthy Slides If there’s one thing a TEDx audience likes to criticize, it’s bad slides. Are there ever bad slides at TED? Here are five key slide traps to avoid:\nSlides covered in text. Text-heavy slides are associated with long, rambling lectures, not TED. Slides with overused or outdated images. Forget Microsoft clip art. They went out of fashion at the end of the 1990s. Slides with poor quality visuals and watermarks. This just tells your audience that you’re too cheap to buy them from a decent image bank. Go for the good stuff (iStock, Getty Images…) Slides showing inappropriate fonts. Avoid Comic Sans. Slides with inconsistent fonts, sizing, colors. Creating good visuals for a TED talk isn’t rocket science, and your coach will help you. But here are a few tips to get you started:\nRespect the golden rule: only use slides that clarify or reinforce your message. Choose black backgrounds over white backgrounds as spectators are usually under dim lighting where bright backgrounds are more visually aggressive and tire the eyes. Use words sparingly. Only include one sentence or idea per slide. Once in a while you can break the rule, but not too often! If you make it easier on the audience, they’ll make it easier on you. Favor sans serif fonts over serif fonts. Go for Arial, Helvetica, Futura, Avenir and Gill sans. These fonts are generally easier to read from a distance than serif fonts such as Times and Palatino. Only use slides when you need them. It is possible to only have slides for a part of your presentation. We like using a black slide to bring attention back to the speaker and reconnect with the audience. Use beautiful, fresh, good quality images. These engage emotion and add an aesthetic touch to your talk. Make sure you have the legal rights to use these images, either by buying them from an image bank or getting photographer permission. Without permission, your talk will not be published online. Use VERY simple graphs and graphics. If you’re using videos, check that they work and are embedded in your slides (NEVER rely on internet connection for your content). Rehearse effectively Rehearsal for TED is crucial. Some people don’t like rehearsing, but that’s often because they don’t rehearse well or enough. Without rehearsing, your presentation might be good, but it won’t be excellent. If you rehearse once, or twice, you will have rehearsed but not enough to really assimilate your content and be fully present on stage; you will hesitate, fumble and feel uncomfortable. Keep going! Move through the uncanny valley by practicing at least 10 times, ideally before sleep the few weeks before the event. Persist and you will be ready for the nerves and excitement that will be there the day of the event. Working with a coach will also bring your mastery, ease and confidence to the next level.\nHere are a few tips to help you rehearse more effectively:\nDon’t spend too long presenting yourself. If the event is well organized, the master of ceremony will do it for you, leaving you to take the stage and head straight into your introduction. If you have to present yourself, keep it short. Stick to what they need to know in order to help the audience understand your talk. Practice making eye contact in different areas of the room. We suggest clients place Post-it notes with smiley faces around their space to simulate people in different areas. Familiarize yourself with the slide-changing clicker which you will use during the event. You don’t want to be the speaker that clicks their slides through in reverse order. Or the one who presses the blocking option, rendering it impossible to advance the slides. Be mindful of your pacing. Are you speaking too fast or too slow? Use pauses when you want to give the audience time to think about something, emphasize a point or create suspense. Record yourself. I know you don’t feel like doing that, but it’s the best way to improve by yourself. Rehearse a lot and rehearse early on. Rehearse more than you think you need to. Once you don’t need to think about your content, then you can embody it. The best TEDx speakers rehearse a LOT! On the Big Day You’ve finished your rehearsals. You’re finally ready to give your TED talk and be a star on stage. There’s nothing left to do, right? Well, actually … there is.\nChoose your attire wisely When speaking at TED (x), we suggest dressing in the same way that you dress for your work. Of course there are exceptions depending on your domain. For instance, if you work in a research laboratory you are not required to turn up in a lab coat. But it’s a good idea to dress in a way that corresponds to who you are in relation to what you do professionally or in your topic of expertise. If you’re a fashion designer, you probably won’t be wearing a suit and tie. If you are a politician, you probably won’t come in jeans and a t-shirt.\nA few dress tips for the occasion (to be adapted depending on the context):\nDon’t over dress. Aim for comfort, confidence and class. For reasons of credibility, don’t come scruffy or underdressed. As I said, jeans and a t-shirt will work if it corresponds to you, such as a class Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Avoid checkered or striped clothing as they don’t always look good on camera. Think about wearing a belt or have something where you can attach a microphone transmitter, it’s a small box about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Gents rarely have this problem, as they wear trousers with pockets, but dresses can be difficult. You don’t want to be the person who had to hook their transmitter to their underwear. Think about a place where you can hook a microphone tie pincer if this type of microphone is being used. Lapels can work very well or even a large shirt collar. Avoid complicated or very tight clothes. Don’t wear dangly earrings as they can rattle against the microphone and cause unwanted noise. The Final Rehearsal If you can, rehearse in the event space. I cannot recommend this enough, as it provides valuable information to you as you try to get your bearings around the stage and the auditorium in front of you. Ask the event organizer if you can do this early on, as there are some important elements to take into account that you couldn’t have clocked during previous rehearsal.\nMake a b-line for the technical person in charge of the slides and check with them that all videos and slide animations are working. They are one of your best friends on the big day. A good rapport there works wonders for confidence and any technical support.\nTest the microphone and check the volume. Be particularly careful of its position in relation to your mouth, this will have a big impact on your audibility. Too vertical or close to the mouth and we’ll hear the ’P’s and ’B’s more than is enjoyable.\nGet your bearings; memorize the position of the screen behind you and where your monitor screen is. Where is the timer? Where is the best lit part of the stage? Often, TEDx organizers will place the famous red circle on the floor for the speaker to stand on. Anyone lighting the stage will automatically prioritize this spot. This is all useful to know, as you will be filmed, and it’s important the camera person can easily track you.\nRehearse imagining the audience present. Don’t forget to practice looking at every corner of the room. If the room is dark and the stage is lit with very bright lights or a follow spot, you won’t see the audience. This is not a problem in an empty venue as a rehearsal, but during the event itself it’s quite different. Some speakers might take comfort in the idea of not seeing their audience, but I would recommend that you see the audience whenever possible. You are not an actor in a play, you are messenger conversing with each and every person in the room. You need their eyes. You need real-time audience feedback.\nBefore Going on Stage You have finished your final rehearsal. Now comes possibly the most stressful moment: the waiting around (did you know that most people prefer to do something pointless rather than do nothing?) So, here are a few tips to help you cope with this difficult moment:\nAvoid coffee, tea, fruit juice and very cold drinks. The drinks will either make you more nervous, dry your mouth out altering your vocal cords or provoke the need to use the restroom. Find the way to your dressing room or lounge where you are made up and where you will keep your belongings (not all events offer such luxuries, but you may be pleasantly surprised). Find out your exact time on stage and find out who will take you there. Familiarize yourself with the route from the lounge to the stage: sometimes it can be long and we have known speakers who got lost. Breathe calmly and deeply to help you to relax if you have any kind of stage fright. If it helps you, try to find out where your friends are sitting in the theater to take comfort in envisioning them supporting and listening attentively to you. Don’t isolate yourself: don’t let your mind go down the rabbit hole. Present yourself and talk to the other speakers, assistants and organizers. It’s time! There you have it. You are a TED speaker. The wait is over. You make your way to make up if you haven’t already done it. The previous speaker has finished. The MC comes on stage, thanks the previous speaker and begins to introduce you. This is your moment! Walk on confidently, breath, ground yourself in the red dot, and begin. Your hard work is paying off and you are ready to shine!\nWhat’s next? Being a TEDx Speaker can often open new doors. Many people say that it changed their life. Be ready to share, discuss with your audience and enjoy the experience during and after. Also, be ready to share your talk widely as soon it goes live online!\nTo Conclude We really believe a great presentation can change the world. I hope that this guide was useful, and that it will help you make your TED talk an unforgettable moment in your life.\nRevision History Jan. 27, 2022: English version/SCORE June 22, 2016: added advice on not wearing big earrings and improved a few sentences.

Now most of those meetings are online, and they’re no better: in fact, they are even more tiring.\nOur Virtual Meeting Revolution training offers a completely new approach to make everybody more productive, and turn each virtual meeting into a real success.\nA 5-step method for imagining and leading a successful online meeting 1. Foundation Understand the context, set clear objectives and choose the right participants.\n2. Ideation Controlled brainstorming to find the right ingredients for your meeting to achieve its objectives.\n3. Creation Arrange the ingredients in a clear agenda that maximizes attention and interaction.\n4. Illustration Prepare effective visual aids (slides) and documents to support your online meeting.\n5. Connection Speak to gain and keep attention, and lead your online meeting professionally.\nWhat are the 5 flavors of virtual meetings? What are the 4 categories of online meeting objectives? Which 5 types of people should you invite to your meeting – and who should you not invite? How should you use slides effectively in virtual meetings? How should I set up my home office for success in online meetings? Discover the answers to these questions and many more, and learn how to use our unique Meeting Agenda Planner, in our groundbreaking Virtual Meeting Revolution course.\nOption 1: one day, 100% online How better to demonstrate how to run successful virtual meetings than with a completely virtual course? A whole day online might frighten some people, but we show participants that it is possible to keep people listening attentively all day long, if the meeting is well organized and planned.\nOption 2: Three online modules Some clients prefer to run the course over several short modules instead of a whole day. We therefore also run Virtual Meeting Revolution as three modules, each lasting 90-120 minutes, planned according to your availability.\nAttention \u0026amp; interactivity Keeping attention in online meetings is tough, and it’s the same in online training courses.\nWe used our own 5-step Virtual Meeting Revolution method to imagine and build this course, which consists of several short interactive ”plenary” modules, exercises in sub-groups, individual reading time – and breaks.\nIn this way, time flies, and participants discover not only an end-to-end method and a new approach to online meetings, but also an example of what is possible. This, combined with our highly entertaining trainers, makes sure nobody loses attention in our courses!\nTraining for small groups The Virtual Meeting Revolution course can accept up to 30 participants, with two trainers, or up to 10 participants with one trainer. We use virtual breakout rooms for exercises so participants can learn by doing, not just by listening.\nWe run our courses using Zoom, unless you prefer to use your own standard video meeting technology.\nBig groups? No problem! If you have more than 30 people to train, or you simply want to share the learning as widely as possible in your organization, we can run Virtual Meeting Revolution as a series of interactive webinars. Although participant microphones will mostly be muted in large-group webinars to preserve sound quality, we still make these sessions as interactive and entertaining as possible, using chat and polls for example, and taking participant questions regularly.\nA comprehensive participant workbook Our objective is to ensure participants remember what they learn, and have the tools to put it into practice.\nKnowing well that slides make poor documents and documents make poor slides, we use powerful visual aids during the course, but we don’t simply print or share them because they wouldn’t be very useful months or years later.\nInstead, participants receive a detailed, standalone workbook which will help them during the course, but which is also a practical reference guide they can use and re-use to prepare virtual meetings.\nExperienced trainers As specialists in presentations and organizing major business conferences and events, and with ten years of experience both teaching executives and working remotely with leaders and presenters around the world, Ideas on Stage is ideally positioned to revolutionize not only business presentations but also online meetings. This course and our methodology are based on our real-life experience and best practices from leading companies around the world.\nJoin the Revolution!
