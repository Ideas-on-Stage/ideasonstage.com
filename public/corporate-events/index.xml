      <description>&amp;ldquo;Good enough&amp;rdquo; is not good enough. Storify your event and turn it into a unique moment people will love and talk about. Turn a traditional corporate meeting into a powerful opportunity to engage the media, partners, employees, clients or suppliers.
Our Event Design team has made an impact with luxury firms, large pharmaceutical companies, industry leaders, public conferences and more.
Traditional conferences could achieve so much more with a little more.</description>

      <description>A Master of Ceremonies for your event Our Master of Ceremonies will go beyond the traditional animator. They are entertainers, storytellers, showrunners, but it&amp;rsquo;s only the surface. They will immerse themselves in your event&amp;rsquo;s specific culture and add another dimension with their thought-provoking questions.
We have acted as Master of Ceremonies for numerous events for well-known companies such as Airbus, Microsoft, EDF and Pierre Fabre, as well as industry congresses and charity events, including COP21 and the World Social Forum.</description>
