The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.
The Business Presentation Revolution, accompanied by the book of the same name, is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method.</description>

Pitching is critical to the success of any startup, because no matter how great your idea, product or service, you still have to convince investors, clients and/or bankers to trust you with their money.</description>
