description: Initially a classically trained actor with 12 years of experience on stage and screen, Michael swapped his passion for acting in favour of business communication and design. Before joining Ideas on Stage, in parallel to his acting career, Michael spent many years creating and delivering original presentation training courses for some of Franceâ€™s biggest companies.<br /><br />Today, apart from training and coaching executives from all sectors and industries and helping them develop content, Michael also coaches speakers at hugely successful TEDx and WikiStage conferences. He has also coached many start-ups, notably for Microsoft Accelerator, Numa Sprint and Business France, and teaches presentation skills at Celsa-Sorbonne, IPAG Paris and INSEEC, both in English and in French. Michael still takes to the stage himself, but instead of acting, he delivers entertaining keynotes and acts as Master of Ceremonies for company events.
