text: When I was running the Microsoft Accelerator program, Ideas on Stage were more or less the only organization we worked with for startup pitch training. They were by far the best in the market and had a solid reputation. Their work was unmatched, very professional, organized, timely and they provided terrific feedback and help to our startups. We consistently received great feedback on our events thanks to Phil and his team.
