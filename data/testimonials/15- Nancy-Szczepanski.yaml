text: As Academic Coordinator/Senior Program Manager at HEC Paris, I had the pleasure of working with Phil numerous times. He is an engaging and inspiring speaker who excels at what he does, and with each experience he was able to quickly and easily connect with his audience. Needless to say, he always received the highest of evaluations from our clients and was equally appreciated by the HEC administration.
