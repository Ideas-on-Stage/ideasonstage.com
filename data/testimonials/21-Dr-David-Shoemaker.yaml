text: I really enjoyed working with Joe Ross in preparing for a TEDx presentation. He was remarkably artful in taking my fixed points of departure — content, background, and worldview — and gently forming it into something that fit the constraints of the TEDx format, and helping pace me in preparing for it in a timely way. But I did not fully appreciate his contribution to the success of the TEDx event until I saw him during the final rehearsals with the full collection of presenters, who represented a very broad sample across subject matter, level of familiarity with public speaking, innate inclination to communicate in that medium, and simple preparedness. The end result came across as an integrated whole, and this had a lot to do with Joe’s coaching on the individual level and his ability to knit it all together.
