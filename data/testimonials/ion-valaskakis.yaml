    text: Joe is the kind of coach you want in your corner when you need to do something big and outside your comfort zone - like giving a TED Talk or a crucial business presentation. He will clarify your message to its core, sharpen your delivery and push you to do your best work - all with a smile on his face. It was a pleasure to work with him and I'd do so again in a heartbeat.
