    text: If the talk went well, it was in no small part thanks to you. It was delightful working together, and you used just the right amount of push while respecting what I felt I had to say. Iâ€™ve done many talks over the years, yet this was the first time I was mentored, and hesitant though I was, I found it most helpful. Thank you.
