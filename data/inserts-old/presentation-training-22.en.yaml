description: "This practical women-only workshop was developed by Marion Chapsal, a leading expert in gender-balanced leadership. This is not going to be your traditional corporate training, so be prepared to work and play on the edge. We will talk and reflect, but also play, improvise, draw, relax and create. Bonus: you will be introduced to Marionâ€™s innovative and fun 3 D coaching method, playing with archetypes."
