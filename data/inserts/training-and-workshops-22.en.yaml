description: "In Women on Stage weâ€™ll explore a way to be heard, taken seriously, and given the authority to make change we so clearly see, without giving up on our femininity, and allowing us to express all the nuances of our emotions, personality and intelligence.
Discover the power of PRESENCE and develop your unique presence on stage. Here and NOW. Neither feminine, nor masculine, but integrating your whole self, mind, body and heart."
