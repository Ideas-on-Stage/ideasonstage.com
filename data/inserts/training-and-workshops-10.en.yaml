description: "Presentations are everywhere in business, and most of them fail to reach their objectives - if they even have clear objectives. The Business Presentation Revolution tears up the conventional wisdom and provides trainees a simple new method for producing great presentations that hit the mark every time.
The Business Presentation Revolution is based on our exclusive Presentation SCORE Method. This course is taught in leading companies and forms part of the HEC Paris Executive MBA curriculum."
