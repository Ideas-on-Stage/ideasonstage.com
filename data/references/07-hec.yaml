description: "HEC Paris Executive Education is consistently rated #1 in Europe - and sometimes #1 worldwide - by the Financial Times. Ideas on Stage co-founder Phil Waknell has been teaching presentation skills there since 2010, both in the HEC Executive MBA course and in private courses for HEC Le Ch√¢teau, in English and French, consistently achieving some of the top participant evaluations. More recently, Ideas on Stage colleagues Marion Chapsal and Michael Rickwood have also begun to deliver courses for HEC Paris Executive Education, including courses in Qatar."
