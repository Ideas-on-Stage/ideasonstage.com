description: Most international businesses bring their top managers together at least once a year, but instead of making best use of this time to achieve clear objectives, most companies just sit them in an auditorium for several days and make them listen to increasingly boring presentations. The pharma arm of Pierre Fabre wanted to do something different. Ideas on Stage helped them to set clear objectives, create an interesting and interactive agenda, build a memorable theme, and work with session leaders to ensure every part of their annual management retreat was an event in itself. We also produced high-quality slides, coached speakers, and animated the event with one of our experienced on-stage MCs. The result? Participants loved the event, the organisers met their objectives - and we're now working with them for the third year running.
