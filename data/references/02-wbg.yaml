description: "What happens when you are sitting on a wealth of know-how and knowledge and it isn't being shared?  The answer: nothing!  This is one of the challenges we faced with the World Bank's sixty-year treasure trove of development experience.  We created the roadmap to help launch an Open Learning Campus where not only is knowledge shared and disseminated, practitioners are also able to find each other.  This effort was so successful that we were invited back to give a master class in Strategic Storytelling to the Bank's most senior management. Result: those senior managers are sharing the tools within their divisions and crucial world-changing knowledge is once again flowing!"
