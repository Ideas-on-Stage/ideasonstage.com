description: As the French government's official agency for promoting French businesses abroad, Business France regularly sends delegations of startups and small businesses to major international events like SxSW, WebSummit and CES, under the 'French Tech' banner. Before they go, Business France ensures that Ideas on Stage coaches all the startups on how to pitch in English, so they can make the most of these events to build their brands and networks and gain maximum media exposure.
