description: Consultants are often known for being the worst, most boring presenters. PriceWaterhouseCoopers France decided to do something about it, and asked Ideas on Stage to deliver a Presentation Zen keynote during one of their regular team meetings. This was so popular that we were asked back for a second keynote going into more depth on storytelling. As the official training provider for Presentation Zen, the world's most popular presentation book by Garr Reynolds, we are the only people apart from Garr authorised to deliver official Presentation Zen keynotes.
