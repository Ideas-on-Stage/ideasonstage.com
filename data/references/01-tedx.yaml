description: This is the question that one of our clients faced in 2009, the world famous photographer and eco activist Yann Arthus-Bertrand. He was only the second French speaker invited since TED became a public conference, the other being Philippe Starck. At the time nobody knew about TED in France. Except us. Yann was incredibly happy to find a company that not only knew TED but could help him prepare his talk and his slides in English. We worked together and, despite the stress of the day and immense pressure on his shoulders, he did a brilliant job on stage. His talk helped create awareness for his upcoming movie “Home", a beautiful tale about fragile Earth and its inhabitants, us.

They have revolutionized the way we think of what great presentations should be. From scientists to artists, from entrepreneurs to inspirers, we’ve helped them turn their knowledge into amazing presentations. We have also helped many companies organize internal events inspired by the TED format to spread their knowledge and ideas.
