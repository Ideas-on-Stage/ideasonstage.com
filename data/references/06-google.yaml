description: Even the most technical subjects can greatly benefit from storytelling. We helped Google deliver a persuasive talk about the Java language and its future. We started by preparing a script to make the speaker's knowledge accessible and explain delicate issues. Then we created great, inspiring and surprising visuals to reinforce the message. We then helped the speaker master the delivery of his presentation, helping him rehearse and become familiar with the environment of the stage.
