description: Ideas on Stage has been coaching startup CEOs in the Microsoft Accelerator Paris program since it began in 2013. Our pitch masterclasses and personal coaching have helped dozens of startups to raise over $50 million from investors as well as to win clients and speak to the media. Our value to startups at Microsoft Accelerator - and many other startup structures like France Digitale and Business France - is particularly strong because we coach in both English and French, and because we help them on the content of their pitches as well as the design of their slides and the quality of their speaking.
