e is short for "elements"

The elements folder contains very short snippets of common HTML/Hugo code that can be reused in multiple pages to help reduce the maintenance costs.

Try to limit these snippets to a single html <tag></tag> element, for example:
- <img>
- <a>...</a>
- <p>...</p>
- <div>...</div>
